Reviews, News, Discussions and whatever the hell we want to talk about. \nI binge shows like it's my job. I wish it were. We're all passionate about some show, character, story arc or something. \nSo it doesn't matter if It's Doctor Who, Sons of Anarchy or Breaking Bad. Let's talk about it!\n\nNew videos Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays."}
