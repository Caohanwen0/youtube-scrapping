I'm Mokuro and I love to create - whether it be lyric videos, memes, crack videos, or music videos. Eventually, I might start doing other things such as gameplay or vlogs, but in the meantime, I'm just enjoying what I do with the time I have. So, come and join me, hang out for a bit, listen to some music, and just chill. I'm a cool person, I swear."}
