I'm Molly. Welcome to my channel! I like reacting to horror, fantasy, geeky things, and other fun tv shows and movies. I play Mortal Kombat 11 and other fighting games (Guilty Gear Strive, Killer Instinct, Street Fighter V, Skullgirls, VF5) whenever possible and post related content as well. I also enjoy collecting, books, animals, art, and tattoos.\n\nCheck out my patreon page!   http://www.patreon.com/MollyBeeReacts\nDonations: https://streamlabs.com/molly_bee/tip"}
