Need to meet or want to exceed your sales goals? Be a better manager or CEO or small business owner? I can help.\n\nIf you are serious about improving your odds to be successful in this concrete jungle, I will teach you how to become a 'PERSON OF INTEREST', and show you how to stand out like a Zebra, and bolt like a Cheetah.\n\nDrawing from our unique past experiences, both good and traumatic, we all have special value in life. I use my championship coaching background, combined with education and hands-on experience in business, then blend it with my entrepreneurial zeal to coach you. I am told I bring the energy of a Zig Ziglar and the deep methodology of a Stephen Covey.\n\nEither you are a coach, you are getting coached, or you don't want a coach. This is \"The Coaching Revolution\"."}
