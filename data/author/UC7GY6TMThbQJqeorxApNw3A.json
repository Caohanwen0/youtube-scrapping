This page contains useful videos, bulletins, and other information to help prevent and solve crime in the Nation's Capital.\n\nThe Crime and Investigations playlist is a collection of current open cases that detectives have shared in the hopes that the public can assist them in identifying and/or locating the individuals depicted within the video. These videos come from private security systems, public CCTV cameras, and other sources and every person shown is treated as a person of interest in the matter and is not necessarily suspected of any wrongdoing. Detectives are interested in speaking with the person or persons shown to gather information related to the case. Your assistance in identifying or locating these individuals is greatly appreciated and may mean the difference between a case being solved and it going \"cold.\" Rewards are offered for information. For details, see www.mpdc.dc.gov/rewards."}
