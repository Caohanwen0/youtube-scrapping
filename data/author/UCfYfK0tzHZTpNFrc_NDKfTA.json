I am also an avid Raspberry Pi guy and will start a tutorial series on that as soon as I finish the Arduino material. In addition, I have had some pretty good success on sending electronics packages to the edge of space on High Altitude Balloons, and will be sharing what I have learned about that. Subscribe to this channel, Buckle Up, and lets do some exciting projects together."}
