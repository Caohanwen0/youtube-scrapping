Do you like getting your knowledge via a mildly sarcastic British man with expressive eyebrows? This is the youtube channel for you.\nI also occasionally review other things too.\n\nYou can also find me on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/The-Dom-1384329085170616/\nAnd Twitter: https://twitter.com/Dominic__Noble\n\nBusiness email below if you wish to contact me."}
