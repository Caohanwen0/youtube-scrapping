Since our first episode in June 2013, we have attracted over 90 regular contributors, 10 editors, and recorded almost 600 hours of original content. And best of all, anyone can put up their hand to be on VoK, so long as they help organize, record and edit the episode. Thus far, we have hosts who span Five separate continents (Asia, Europe, Australia, South America and North America), and argue in a variety of different accents. But the one language we all share is geek!"}
