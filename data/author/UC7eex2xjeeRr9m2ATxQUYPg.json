XD\n\nThis channel is primarily for any music that I cover, both solo and collaborations. The secondary function is for any con videos that I happen to record. Usually this is from Comic Con, as a lot of shows that I am a fan of have panels there and I try to capture as much as I caaaannn.\n\nFor me, the way I express my passion for something is to do a cover on it. Music is one of the main things that I pay attention to in a show, movie, video game, and having good music can really elevate the experience and enjoyment. My videos can really range from various songs, tv shows, movies, and video games that I'm a fan of and whose music I enjoy."}
