I'm a native English speaker from Australia (with a very \"neutral\" accent \ud83d\ude09). I love learning languages - I speak French, German, Spanish, and some Italian, Indonesian and Portuguese - and I hope I can help you learn my native language. Language isn't just a tool. Let's have fun with it!\n\nRemember that English subtitles are available for all videos."}
