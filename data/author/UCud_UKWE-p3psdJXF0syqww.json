Raised in a Christian faith-based upbringing, in addition to scripture I was drawn to studying countless literature on astrology, spirituality and the art of using tools for divination embracing the knowledge with an open mind and discerning spirit. \n\nReluctant to use my gift publicly for many years, I began doing general readings here based on the zodiac in 2014 under The Pelican Brief. After monetization, thousands of subscribers, and fulfilling private readings for clients all over the globe, I was pulled into a different focus and deleted my channel. I missed it so I'm back on a go with the flow basis which will hopefully help anyone in need of clarity. I have no interest in fame or idolization just simply to use my gift. \n \nI do not offer personal readings."}
