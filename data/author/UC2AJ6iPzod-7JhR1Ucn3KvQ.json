I am a Crystal Indigo apart of the new generation who with many others like me were sent here to change the world.  My Channel is all about enlightenment, being your true self, loving who you are and how to cope in a world that is filled with chaos when you project compassion, kindness and care. I will talk about metaphysical, crystals, healing techniques and meditation topics. I encourage anyone who has a topic they would like me to post a video on just send me a message I would be happy to post I hope you like comment and share my videos Love and Light."}
