Open dancefloors; where music, ideas and people meet.\n\nBoiler Room started with a webcam taped to a wall, broadcasting from a warehouse in London, opening a keyhole to the city\u2019s underground. DIY at its finest; raw, uncut, homemade.\n\nAs an independent music platform and cultural curator we remain true to that history. Connecting club culture to the wider world, on screen and irl though parties, film and video.\n\nSince 2010, we\u2019ve built a unique archive; featuring over 7,500 performances, by more than 7,000 artists, spanning 250 cities, enabling everyone regardless of where they live to enjoy the freedom it stands for.\n\nOur remit is to platform music in new ways - sound on for the voices and stories of the fringes of the mainstream.\n\nBoiler Room - watch, listen, dance."}
