I'll try and make this brief so I am not wasting your time. I am mainly a reactor on YouTube. I am a bisexual geek with a passion to create and care and is afraid of being normal haha. Anywho, I try my best to stick to a schedule but I hope you guys enjoy my reactions as much as I enjoy being able to dish them out for you to watch. I don't really do requests as time is pretty tight anyways and I don't want to be in any partnerships. I'd recommend following my Twitter account too as I may reveal information such as live streams etc but it's up to you. Hope you have fun and may the force be with you.
