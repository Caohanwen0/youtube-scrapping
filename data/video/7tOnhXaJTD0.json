I loved the idea and everything but it was way too short and I wanted a better explanation and kind of expected one. And I still think it would be cool if Ryan filled in plot holes in the ahs universe than create more like. What happened to Scarlett and Lachlan? (Hotel) what happened to Lee\u2019s daughter Emily? (Roanoke) how about kits kids (asylum) What about Bette and dot and Jimmy\u2019s baby? (Freak show) I could go on for hours about how many cool things he could do with this show that would connect to the original show that\u2019s what I kind of expected for American horror stories not a bunch of stories and are all completely new people I thought we\u2019d see some more backstories and stuff like that", "I love the play on Horror movie stereotypes. Normally, the characters having sex are killed but in this episode, the making out is what actually saved them.", "I enjoyed it, as ahs is bae, but am I the only one who wants a darker spin off instead of the teeny bopper stuff? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m having fun, but I don\u2019t feel the scares as much. You da best Mary! So glad to see some reviews!\ud83d\udda4missed you gurllll", "He has the Rolls Royce because of the Netflix deal? \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "I think this was an improvement over the first 2 episodes .i loved the horror .i would have seen a full movie based on this concept"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nJoin the Freaks of AHS on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheFr..."}
