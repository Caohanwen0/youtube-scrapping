The feral humans reminded me of the hills have eyes! Great episode!", "This episode was the only one in my opinion that was just well acted, well written straight horror. Loving the focus on urban legends and actually sympathetic characters. The ending was super shocking and I loved that.

Sensational time watching this week. Hope they can keep it going for episode 7 :)", "The actor who played the father played Danny in Grease Live and started in the Les Mis movie.

I thought I saw Naomi Grossman (Pepper) as one of the monsters....."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4GPRqEoZ4zpnTHIxcG5JyQ", "description": "Wow, that was the best episode by far.
