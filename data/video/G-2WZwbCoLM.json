I love how Ryan Murphy explored the lengths a mother will go to to protect her child.", "Nan would have to be my favorite underrated character", "I like Mallory. She's not super duper boom boom powerful. To me, if the writers gave more attention to the characters we'd see a more morose and melancholy Mallory. To me she gives me a very gloomy and kind of sad vibe. Mixed with her power and her loyalty to the coven just makes her such an interesting and amazing character that I think id just visually stunning.
