What if she is brought back for some reason, survives the apocalypse and because either the antichrist has something she wants or because she hates the witches for what they did to her she betrays them and goes in cahoots with the antichrist? Literally kissing ass to the devil", "Me thinks Venable bought the murder house and that\u2019s where the bunker is.", "Lana Del Rey should be a Witch in this season", "The one thing Satan didn't anticipate: Madison Montgomery kicking him and his son's asses. Our witch queen will conquer.", "Mary: you mentioned the apocalypse is going to be biblical based so I\u2019m curious how will the 4 horsemen manifest? Will it be mere events or characters?
