I have completed 8 complete binge watchings of it from beginning to end.   I will continue to enjoy it.", "Scenes like this is why Person of Interest was one of CBS's best shows.  The show started off as somewhat typical procedural  and eventually became so much more than that.", "One of the best eps of POI. Jim Caviezel is a brilliant actor, deserves every award going.", "This show deserved an HBO budget.", "My favorite episode.  Not a single shot fired, before Elias, before HR and before Root/Shaw.  Just good writing and acting."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnurTYr5C_puLSWQ-ybS7Kg", "description": "Person of Interest - Every Thursday on CBS"}
