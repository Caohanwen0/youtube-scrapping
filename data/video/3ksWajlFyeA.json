This is definitely one of my fave episodes. the way root plays denken weekes AND harold is just GOLD! she's just so good at hacking people. it makes me think that Root purposely never got any physical training (until later on with shaw that is). it lets her play average characters much more convincingly, especially to deceive professionals like John and Shaw, and it lets her use her physical weakness to her advantage (e.g. get people to lower their guards). Root is definitely an all time fave character for me"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiCcLjTAZWGj5dh3QzNTxPA", "description": "Carter and Reese continue investigating.\nFinch and friend try to outsmart Root.\nFeaturing: Root childhood backstory.\n\nEpisode summary: \nRoot brutally interrogates Denton Weeks over the location of the Machine, accusing him of having what she calls \"bad code\". To prove that Denton is \"bad code\", she allows Finch to help Denton temporarily escape and pretends to be subdued. Once Denton realizes that Finch was involved with the creation of the Machine, he tries to kill Finch, but Root kills Denton instead after he reveals the Machine's location to be somewhere in Salt Lake City. Meanwhile, Reese continues to follow the trail of the missing girl supplied by the Machine in \"The Contingency\". Her name was Hanna Frey, a girl abducted outside a library. The one witness to the crime was Hanna's friend Samantha Groves, who informed the librarian (Margo Martindale) what she saw, only for the librarian to accuse Sam of lying, because she was in love with the man that Sam had accused. The experience started Sam down a path that would ultimately lead to her becoming Root. Now knowing Root's real name, Reese is able to track her movements through bank accounts, to triangulate Weeks' location. He arrives in time to find Weeks dead and Root gone, having taken Finch with her to Union Station. Finch leaves a clue to where he is being taken by using a tap code on a telephone handset. Reese decodes the clue in order to follow and save Finch, but Root is able to escape before Reese can apprehend her.\n\nOctober 4, 2012\n\n+116"}
