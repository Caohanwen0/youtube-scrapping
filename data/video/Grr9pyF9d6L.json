It gets me every time and it doesn't seem to matter how many times I see it, then again I'm such a softie. Thanks for reacting to this.", "Ghosts- Thank you so much, Mega! I really enjoyed your reaction for this episode very much. Even with the lagging and the lawnmowing in the background, which I promise wasn't too terrible. As always, this episode for this show is really great, and I am absolutely loving your reactions throughout these first two episode reactions. :) ", "I love starting this series over with reactors. Season 2 is personal favorite so I'll be back!", "In the flashback when Nathan confronts Harold - one of the pictures is John's girlfriend.", "@8:15, that's john's wife on the computer where he says \"we built it to save everybody\""], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2KSKx7OvnWKyQwREVjKi7Q", "description": "Welcome to Mega Reacts! \nSupport me on Patreon for uncut reactions and the ability to vote in polls to decide what I react to next. https://www.patreon.com/megareacts"}
