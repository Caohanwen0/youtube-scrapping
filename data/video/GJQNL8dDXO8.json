Lana winters, madam lalourie , the countess etc. I personally feel like the first 5 seasons was the golden era of ahs season 6 and 7 were good but had ALOT of issues season 8 was disappointing and terrible and season 9 was a roller coaster in quality when it was good it was goooood and when it was bad it was just plain hard to watch. I hope we can return to the batshit crazy show I fell in love with.", "I think, or at least hope, season 10 will be about a seaside town that is invaded by mythical creatures or the aliens.", "Adina liked my tweet welcoming her back for AHS10 Yas Queen!", "The beach setting has got me really excited for it to be a cruise ship or something. I\u2019ve wanted that for so long"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nJoin the Freaks of AHS on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheFr..."}
