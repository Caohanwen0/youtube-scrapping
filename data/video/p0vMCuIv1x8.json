I know everyone thinks Kai is Oz's father but what if it's Rudy. He is true power behind the cult and Maybe he is related to Winter and Kai Perhaps their big brother or If we wanna go on a stretch he could be their father and Oz is their brother. AND that's why Ally is connected to the cult.", "Kai's tune is amazing", "I loved this episode. It started off slow, but really picked up. And that last 10 mins was amazing.", "I'm loved the new episode!", "I think it would have been great if the video from the dark web that winter showed oz was a clip from return to Roanoke three days in hell."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "Due to Copyright Restrictions, this video is a reaction video only.
