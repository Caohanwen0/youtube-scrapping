So many characters who have died are returning so either this will be set in a time period before their deaths or its the afterlife!", "I have a theory on Adina Porters character Dinah Stevens. I think Dinah Stevens could be a leader of survivors of the Apocalypse. She could be kind of like a modern day Harriet Tubman/Mother Theresa.", "I thought I had an original theory but there were two or three other people in the live stream chat that thought the same thing. There's two coven's one light and one dark, that would answer some questions like why  some people are playing multiple characters and how some people could come back from the dead. Mary thanks for taking the time each week to do a live chat, I enjoyed it as usual.", "You know what I just remembered? Kai, in Cult's second episode, knows Ally came to the door with a knife. Just a thought.", "I was really excited, about Jessica Lange coming back. But, I'm even more excited, about Evan Peters playing Tate again. Tate is one of, if not my favorite, AHS character. \u2764"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nWelcome to American Horror Story Weekly Wednesday Live Stream!
