And where are the writers going to go for Seasons 9 & 10 after the Apocalypse? I can't wait to see how this plays out. And to see the witches again! (the still living ones anyway).", "Idk if anyone has noticed but all of the staticy kinda flickering tv promos have syllables flashing somewhere in them. When you put them all together they spell out the begging is near.", "This is rad af..cant wait for this to actually air. I mean AHS coven was a fav out of all the seasons cuz it focused on magic without losing the terror that this show was about. It has its dull moments sure and some of the fans felt like the ep. towards the ending was rushed. Needless to say, I still LOVE it."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClGiNHyDZPm4jEOo9UyP5Zw", "description": "AHS8 premieres wednesday September 12th, 2018"}
