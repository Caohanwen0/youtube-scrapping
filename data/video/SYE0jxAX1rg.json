She's such a great actress.  She deserves bigger roles in the series.", "In my opinion, this scene, and all the Montgomery flashbacks, are the scariest moments in AHS. Just the superb acting, the music, the cinematography, and the horrific concept of mutilating your only child back to life (something more likely to happen than anything else in the series, making it the most unsettling)", "In my opinion, this family's story was the most disturbing in AHS.", "Lily Rabe is so underrated! In every series I loose my self in her acting not many actors can do that for me.", "lily rabe in that role is just EVERYTHING!!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGIQHvkZPzrna7UHtmlgoXw", "description": "American horror story murder house - tour bus scene (the Montgomery's death) \nS1E7 Open House"}
