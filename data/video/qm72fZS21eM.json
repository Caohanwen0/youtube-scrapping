Love you !", "I want an explanation about Rose and how she lost her eyes, and since she's a ghost, where was she in the Murder House season? Personally though, I would have preferred that Ryan had stuck to what he originally had planned for Constance's 4th child being an albino transvestite, since most who are really into AHS knew about the albino son and saw the photo of him and Tate together.", "I have a feeling we'l never know the story of what happened to Rose's eyes. Or if Madison is one of THOSE Montgomerys.And it will drive us nuts for years!", "I laughed when you were talking about Violet still being in love with Tate.. Girl there are 36 ghosts in that house and her options are limited. Ben is her Dad, Chad and Patrick are gay, so who else would there be to screw around with.? With the remaining options of Beauregard, Travis (As if Constance would allow that), Dallas (the robber guy) Hugo (Constance's husband) I am shocked that she is not rubbing small circles in the window as well."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nVIDEO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR American Horror Story, Season 8, Episode 6!!!\n\nmondaysRmurder channel link: "}
