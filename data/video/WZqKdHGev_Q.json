He'll be an excellent recurring villain against Reese.", "0:53 It's funny, his choice of airport to catch a flight at the end of an episode involving snipers.", "They should have had Wesley as a third party/ally to team Finch and Reese. Would have been great to have Reese and Finch and Fusco cornered by Samaritan's faction, in a firefight and injured, then Wesley and a squad of hiw own men break into a warehouse or building SWAT style via rope diving gunz ablazing"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGU3fjBOY4CYJPgP7W-bguA", "description": "Just a quick video to show that Alistair Wesley's theme (2x07 \"Critical\") is, in fact, John Reese's theme in reverse!
