He was suspected of being Jack the Ripper before opening his hotel and murdering ppl in it", "how the hell does that hotel stay in business?", "Mute this video and watch while listening to The Star Wars intro."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClGiNHyDZPm4jEOo9UyP5Zw", "description": "Season 5 of American Horror Story will be based around the \"Cecil Hotel\". The Cecil Hotel, located in Los Angeles, has a wide history of murders and suicides.\nThe Cecil Hotel was where 21-year-old Elise Lam was found drowned in its water tank in January 2013. A little more digging shows how the hotel was also once home to serial killers Richard \"the Nightstalker\" Ramirez and Jack Unterweger. It's also the last alleged location that Elizabeth Short, also known as the Black Dahlia, was seen before her still-unsolved 1947 murder."}
