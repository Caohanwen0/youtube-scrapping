THANK U mother supreme for speaking the truth about how AHS is gonna be fine without Sarah and  Evan. cast members have been coming in out of different seasons for the entire series that\u2019s a big part of what keeps the show fresh & exciting, Evan not being in this season is not going to affect my watching experience at all & I\u2019m also fine with Sarah being a guest star this time around too plus both have played small roles in the past, Sarah was only in like three episodes of MH & Sally was definitely a side character in hotel. Evan practically just guest stared in Roanoke and last season he was in it  consistently but definitely not as a huge leading role so I really think the shifting cast is one of the many beauties of AHS tbh\ud83d\udda4", "I would also love a connection to Roanoke or Cult.", "Talking about Scream season 3.. I\u2019ve started it and don\u2019t get your hopes up lol. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the first 2 season, new cast, new storyline, new masked killer, all the characters are unlikeable except for Keke Palmer\u2019s character\ud83d\ude29 I\u2019m gonna stick it out and continue watching but it\u2019s nowhere near as good as the first 2 seasons.", "The teaser looks like a test screening for a campy version of a Friday the 13th movie. A similar theme to Roanoake but real murders occur when filming"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "Welcome to American Horror Story Weekly Wednesday Live Stream!
