This isn't a new AHS season, it's rather a spinoff series of AHS.

I was starting to believe this would never come out! :D", "This brought joy to my heart", "This is really exciting summer for me as I will be watching a load of season as they are released (AHSs, AHS & ACS). I binged AHS & ACS over the last month and have been watching loads of Sarah\u2019s movies and shows aswell as loads of other incredible Middle Aged actresses work!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpJN7kiUkDrH11p0GQhLyFw", "description": "First trailer for American Horror Stories Season 1 on Hulu."}
