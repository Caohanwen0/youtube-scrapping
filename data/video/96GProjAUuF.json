I'm very confused by this season but what do you guys think?", "This is actually the one AHS theme that I've wanted since the beginning and was hoping they'd do a slasher season lol.", "I would love you to do a video where you discuss each season of AHS and rank them.", "The best part of AHS is that not everyone loves the same season! It\u2019s just a great talking point. Like for me, I loved Roanoke but most people hated it. I hated cult but I\u2019ve seen people in this comment section that loved it. That\u2019s the beauty in an anthology series", "Please do a ranking! I have not seen all of the seasons so would be really interested to know if I missed a really good one in your opinion \ud83d\ude42"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-exz3M1efabysAyd90ekNQ", "description": "try Shudder free for 30 days! https://www.shudder.com \nuse promo code \"POSSESS30\"\n\nanyone else hoping this is just a big joke and cover up to what their real theme will be??\n\nthank you Shudder for sponsoring this video!\n\nwatch my other AHS reviews!\nAPOCALYPSE | "}
