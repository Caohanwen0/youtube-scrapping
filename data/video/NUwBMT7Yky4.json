I think we see the paintings and naturally assume they are shadows, but if you look closer it could literally be the face of Henry/The Kid existing in one person. Especially when you see that one eye is painted blue and the other brown. Also, The Kid in the 1991 painting isn't wearing the same shirt as young Henry, but a shirt that is the exact opposite of Henry's (light where Henry's is dark and vice versa), possibly hinting at their duality.", "After this episode, I'm back at square one of confusion.", "every episode got me like urghhhhhh I need answer!!!", "No theories. I'm just as clueless as always. I watch the episodes, think they're interesting, then you open up a whole new level of understanding and insight about them. That's got to be a lot of work. Thanks.", "The ending of this episode really scared me for some reason.
