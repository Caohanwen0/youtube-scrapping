If you needed to go for elective surgery when would you go.  I am so afraid of going to the hospital for surgery and then getting Covid. I had my second Pfizer vaccine on the 29th August 2021", "Where can one buy the copper masks please?", "Wow!!!  for a doctor to say \"we would love to name & shame the anti vaxers & unvaccinated\u201c\nis definitely unethical & shameful especially knowing that thousands  have had  bad side effects of an experimental vaccine & those who cannot be vaccinated!", "I just want to suggest\nInstead of just blindly discrediting the anti vaxers why don't you invite credible concerned people like dr susan vosloo on your show and have an honest debate so that we , the morons can make an informed choice if whether to voluntarily jab this toxic poison into our bodies or not. I am just looking for the truth. On your next podcast can u tell us why there has been no deaths from influenza in the past two years?\ud83e\udd14"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeWw7klq-2rOABze8zXWOpg", "description": "Join Howard Feldman, Head of Synthesis Marketing & People, Author and Radio Show Host and Dr. Anton Meyberg, Physician and Pulmonologist for this week's Sunday podcast as they answer all your COVID-19 questions."}
