Plus he is shows some niceties when he doesn't shoot John.", "Reese would be the perfect Bruce Wayne/Batman", "Elias became my most favourite character in the show right at the moment when he told John \"Then we will meet again under less pleasant circumstances\" and finished it with a little bow. The respect he showed here with his niceties and voice tone is enormous. He stayed my favourite till the end of the series. And I absolutely loved Elias and Harold duo and felt excited whenever they shared the screen.", "\"OMG, FINALLY!! 'Permissions been REVOKED!'\ufeff My FAVORITE scene and it's finally up somewhere!\"\n\nHe scared that fat bastard pretty good, didn't he? Reese is SUCH a badass!", "I loved the interplay between Carter and Reese. Especially how it evolved from her hunting him to her being part of the team."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkOQfPHKjU0lQnVpVuqfeew", "description": "***This Video may contain Spoilers if you havent seen some episodes***\n\nPart 2 of 2 of some of my favourite POI scenes from episodes 1-9.
