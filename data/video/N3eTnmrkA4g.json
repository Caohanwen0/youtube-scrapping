Amy Acker has made Root a one of a kind character.", "i think amy acker's talent is what made it possible for a character like root to exist. she could have easily been a one dimensional evil villain much like greer is. much like tatiana maslany on orphan black, when you have an actor who can give you that range of emotion to play with, the character can practically write itself. root is easily the best character on tv right now.", "Root is one of the most complex and fascinating characters I've ever seen!!! And thank goodness for Amy Acker's acting, which is flawless and mind blowing.", "When she says \"whether or not I'm gonna kill you\" I still get the chills. And that says a lot, considering that out of the ~15000 views this video has 14500 views come from me.. Root rocks! ", "Binge watched this recently, love this show and Root is such a great charater can't belive Acker has never been nominated for any awards for playing Root. Whenever Amy Acker or Enrico Colantoni are in a episode you know it's gonna be great."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPiQaJd58GgMs5k970WE38g", "description": "Root talks about the truth."}
