Looking forward to the rest of the series.", "100% didn't expect you to take on this but it's a very welcome video. Love the insight you have on narrative structures like this one!", "It's nuanced perspectives like this that I'm glad these videos are in good hands. \n\nYou'd also make one hell of an adept bridge crew member.", "A very thoughtful guide, I'm looking forward to the next ones! I overall liked the show very much, but think it wasted some potential and interesting ideas that it didn't follow through. I might start a rewatch, as it will be at least a year until we see season 2.
