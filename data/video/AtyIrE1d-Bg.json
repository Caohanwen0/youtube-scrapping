I haven't been able to stop thinking about Crowley and Aziraphale stuck in lockdown since I watched the special, they both sounded so lonely and sad at being Kept apart. This really was made so well. The phone calls at the beginning were edited  perfectly and it was a great song choice.  It's nice to think Aziraphale came round so they're finally together again too.", "This song suit so perfectly to our drama Queen in love with his Angel \ud83d\udc95", "Can we just talk about how Aziraphale has a picture of Crowley in his bookshop?? Cuz I'm not okay", "This is amazing. Tells the story really well, very clever use of the existing shots and dialogue. Also thank you for the happy ending, I would have died!", "Ineffable Con??? Did I miss something?? That sounds amazing.\n\nHOLY SOMEONE THE ENDING HAD ME DEAD"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFAzqzy2bBKy8AqHbSZNNw", "description": "Show: Good Omens\nShip: Crowley/Aziraphale\nSong: All out of Love by Air Supply\n\nI'd say this is a brief compilation of Pining!Crowley and it was supposed to end when the song ends. (Beelzebub: ENDS IN FIRE AND FLAME)\n\nI would have everything blamed to the incomplete fic I read on AO3 about Crowley having a heart too broken and led himself into being discorporated after the call.\n\nYet, the ineffable husbands in me stopped me from having such apocalyptic bad ending and thank GOD now this vid is just Crowley's nightmare during his nap, with Aziraphale waking him up at the end of it :-)\n\nTime to wake up Crowley! It's July! "}
