She was charismatic. She was also the only one who could keep the family united.\nThank you for what you brought to the series, Helen.\n\nHelen McCrory,\nthank you for Peaky Blinders.\nRest in peace.\n\n**\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
