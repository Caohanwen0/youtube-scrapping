Misty knew there was something amiss about her, therefore suggested to bury her and leave it at that. But Zoe insisted, and despite Misty's better instincts, she did so anyway even though it was obviously difficult to, given Madison's rotting state. Despite this, Madison still attempts to kill Misty by having her buried alive, and let Zoe die despite having the power to bring her back to life. So yes, Madison's untimely death wasn't only well-deserved, but also long overdue."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGIQHvkZPzrna7UHtmlgoXw", "description": "American horror story coven - misty & zoe bring Madison back to life"}
