I came across AHS because of the popularity, and I just finished watching season 1 and I was blown away. Hopefully season 2+3+4+5 will just be as good, I hope the new setting and characters won't ruin the show."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCucI17HvK1Iy9AqjzqZ3ZVg", "description": "For more TV videos, TV episodes, TV reviews, celebrity interviews and more, go to:\nhttp://www.tvweb.com"}
