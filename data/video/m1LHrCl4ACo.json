Misty isn't a pacifist, and she doesn't view all life as equally deserving of respect. Plants and animals who have never done anything to her get her compassion. But humans...humans kill animals and other humans for their own gain. Humans burned her at the stake. I love the side of Misty that is cynical and angry at the human race.", "I SERIOUSLY WISH THEY WOULD JUST MAKE A SEASON ABOUT MISTY SHE IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PERSON TO EVER BE ON AHS LIKE AHAHAHAHAHHAHHAH", "Absolutely her best role in the entire series she slayed and was beautiful doing it .", "I wish I had Misty Day's gift", "This is why I love Misty so much. She's so caring for Mother Earth, God, and the worlds creatures. But, yet, don't mess with her or she'll make bastards pay. Just look what happened to Madison, Misty beat her up. And, I'm glad Misty's returning in Apocalypse.
