I\u2019m excited for any ahs content.", "Absolutely LOVE your channel and content! Currently binge watching your videos while smoking a joint \ud83d\udca8", "I enjoyed Stories e1/e2 but it was literally a modern version of AHS: Murder House. It was pretty much the same storyline with a gay couple and a Rubber (Wo)man and a new cast. Shouldn't be that difficult for Ryan to come up with brand new short horror stories. There's literally so many horror ideas he could've used. I guess only time will tell how original they will be with upcoming Stories episodes. So far it seems that there's promise with the rest of the season according to the trailer for stories. But again I did enjoy e1/e2 due to nostalgic reasons and a few violent scenes. I jumped up a couple of times because of jump scares lol (darn Infantata!!!). Btw some of the shots of the house outside of Murder House were beautifully done."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4GPRqEoZ4zpnTHIxcG5JyQ", "description": "American Horror Stories: What to Expect from the AHS Spinoff?
