I do blame AMC for the decline for the most part and ultimately, I bet Gimple will fall on his sword for AMC as the Patsy in the end and loose his job.  Many of the fans want blood for what happened in the decline of the drek storylines, in-cohesive plots, the up & down, unrealistic character development, and ultimately, Carl's \"bite\" was the straw that broke the camel's back.  AMC will be the proverbial Pontius Pilate and eventually wash their hands of Gimple before turning him over to the angry mob of fans for a Scourging & Crucifixion.", "The shade is strong \ud83d\udcaa iconic", "loved this video and i agree \ud83d\udc9c", "I\u2019m personally over the long-ass breaks. It\u2019s still my favorite show...I think? Like I said,the months long breaks are actually making me lose interest. I\u2019ve got a life to live dammit! If I can\u2019t have sort of immediate gratification then after all these years I\u2019m feeling less excited about the show. Sadly.\ud83d\ude41", "Loved this video format Mary! I have a friend that is head over heels for TWD to the point where he will talk about nothing else! It\u2019s crazy to me. I liked the first season, it was cool. Who had put zombies in a tv show before right? Season 2, I lost interest. Season 3 rolled around and I watched for the hell of it. They took Andria and destroyed her and for that, they lost me for good. Now I\u2019m hearing about Tigers and a Baseball bat named Lucy? Like, wtf? It\u2019s all about the money, what a shame."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "***SPOILERS!!!!*** IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE SHOW DON'T WATCH THIS VIDEO!\n\nDISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THE SHOW IN THIS VIDEO.
