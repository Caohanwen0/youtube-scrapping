I've rewatched POI more than most of the shows in my top 5 and it's amazing to me how much high concept detail they layered into the early seasons when it still carried the veneer or a weekly case of the week style show.", "I don't know who's better? John Reese (Person of Interest) or Michael Westen (Burn Notice)? They're both badass characters with great teams!", "Ramin Djawadi's work in this show is underrated", "What if the POI team came to this judge when Sgt Carter needed a subpoena against HR instead of the crooked judge who set her up?"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaQAaNp3x9WI17t-UH-LQbQ", "description": "SPOILER ALERT"}
