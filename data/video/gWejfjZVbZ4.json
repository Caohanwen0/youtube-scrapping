I was a little bit confused with the \u201cYou have no soul\u201d line, I thought it was just weak writing. But I should have expected more from Ahs. Thank you for the theory!", "I think this theory makes a lot of sense because I don\u2019t know if the witches have no souls theory was right so her making this deal and losing her soul to the axeman is the only reasonable explanation I could think of", "They gotta mention Fiona in s8, she was just too important.", "Mary:  that makes total sense. I\u2019ve never realized this before, & I\u2019ve seen Coven numerous times.  You rock!", "Soooo glad that Jessica Lange is back #1 but best of all is #2 she will be playing CONSTANCE LANGDON!! Every time constance starts a epic monologue my eyes cant leave the screen. Constance gave me chills watching her scenes shes that damn good! AHS isnt AHS without Jessica Lange, Ryan was smart to bring her back."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nImages by Danny Vera.
