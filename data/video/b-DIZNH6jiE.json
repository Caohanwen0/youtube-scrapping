Turning to me, she asked, \"Isn't this the song for the POI video?\" I said it was. And then we both smiled. You know a song and video are meant to be paired, when the song comes on and the first thing you think of is the video and the second thing you do is shush everyone so you can relish in the moment. My hat's off to you and your amazing talent. ", "You know, you're the first POI youtuber I see who's put in a video most of the Numbers saved by Finch and John. It's a nice thing to remember sometimes!! :D\nAs for the rest, beautiful song and video, the piece of the phone pairing is priceless!", "This is my favorite Reese and Finch vid, I've watched it over and over and it still gives me feels!!! <3 I love the 'pairing successful' part - clever as hell! Anytime this song comes on the radio now I get all tingly and these Reese and Finch scenes play through my mind! These two are the best dynamic duo ever! Thank you so much for the greatest POI amv!", "\"Pairing Successful\" - cheeky decision, including that phone cloning clip, I laughed. Sweet video. <3", "The \"Pairing Successful\" bit will never not be hilariously on the nose and brilliant. Love this whole video."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkxtWNpoMkoVmbw9j9Jk9g", "description": "A Reese/Finch vid for the television show Person of Interest.
