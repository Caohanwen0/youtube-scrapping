The character of older brother Santo Versace is shown, but he is not a main character in this series, but you do SEE him with Donatella often.  I think Donatella supported Gianni and had his back and didn't judge her brother for being gay, it's just that, from my impression of Donatella, SHE was ALL \"business\" about image, PR, $$$, and running things proper in the Eye of the Public 4 the Brand of Versace.  Donatella after all IS a Taurus.  They are power hungry and domineering, yet VERY Loyal.  I think she always viewed Antonino D'Amico (Ricky Martin) more as a parasite of Gianni's since she knew he coaxed Gianni into orgies ect.  She felt he was not a \"True Love\" or the right man for Gianni to settle down with perhaps.  This is just what I take from it based on what I know of Taurus women.  I think Antonio just never passed Donatella's \"sniff test\".
