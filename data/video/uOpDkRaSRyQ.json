Nick\u2019s trial just works really well for Crowley fjellas, I don\u2019t make the rules.\n\nAlso, this is probably like, the cleanest & biggest animatic I\u2019ve done to date?? (it\u2019s still Messy, but like,,, has backgrounds, semi clean lineart, colour and Many Characters;; which is Beyond what my other ones have been) and I\u2019m actually really chuffed I managed to get it done before my last term @ uni started up :v !! I only,, just managed to scrape that (via an all nighter the day of my first classes, oof.) but!! Still!  Im v happy with how this lad turned out c:\n\n--\n\n\u201c\u201d Animated\u201d\u201d entirely in photoshop over like, a week??
