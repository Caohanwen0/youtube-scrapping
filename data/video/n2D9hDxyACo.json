I want new characters and a story that somehow connects Murder House and Coven. Maybe a new family moves into the Murder House, or the Coven moves in. Maybe the Anti-Christ is a tie-in to the witches. This season should be called American Horror Story: Occult since both seasons are heavily supernatural. It could be an excellent title that connects all of the supernatural elements, of not only Murder House and Coven, but the entire series as a whole."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheFr..."}
