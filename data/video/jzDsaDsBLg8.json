I bet the next Saw film will be another random film just set in the Saw universe. The first seven films had such amazing continuety, and there was so much room for sequels. I don't understand why they're throwing all that away for lazy one offs.", "They need to make the next film \u201cSAW LEGACY\u201d an ultimate fan service.Tying up everything and bringing back everyone from the originals with tons of flashbacks using Tobin Bell as much as they can and from there they could continue to a total reboot or whatever they want.", "This is what I was waiting for.", "i wondered wether Article 8 was a result of the Saw: The Final Chapter finale with Hoffman basically destroying all the cops and then leaving. Also have to wonder if one of the coverups mentioned in Spiral could refer to both Hoffman killing that one unarmed guy in Saw 3D, but also his involvement as the Jigsaw killer, and also my guess that even if Hoffman is dead in the bathroom, which i dont want, his body was never found therefore to everyone it seems like he got away.", "This movie wasn't perfect by a long shot, but somehow I still liked it more than Jigsaw, I don't know, I didn't like how they forced John Kramer making it a prequel-sequel, I think Spiral tries to do its own thing but it would've worked better being a reboot because it seems they didn't want to connect it to the previous movies at all."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4GPRqEoZ4zpnTHIxcG5JyQ", "description": "Spiral: From the Book of SAW Review (\u2026Hooray?)
