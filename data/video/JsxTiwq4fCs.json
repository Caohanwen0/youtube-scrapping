A lot of our favorites are returning this time around (including Sarah Paulson, Lily Rabe, Francis Conroy, and Evan Peters) - and I'm seeing a LOT of references that really make me think of Stephen King stories and settings (particularly The Shining and perhaps a little Salem's Lot). So far, I'm very excited for this season. What do you all think?\n\nThanks to my team/sponsor: Kunoichi Console Gaming League!\n\nIf you're interested in supporting the channel, please consider becoming a member here on YouTube (join button below) or subscribing to my Patreon!
