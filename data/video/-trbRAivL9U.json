With the guards and nurses representing normality, the psychoanalysis and society's way of excluding people that don't fit this pattern. Throughout the whole show they were told by people \"they could be healed\" and \"liberated from all pain\", but there is a forceful element to that. And they just run from it, heal together.", "The reason I thought maybe it's still a simulation (maybe everything is) because in an earlier episode when they're in the pod together and Annie asks Owen why he wanted the Don Quixote page he said his fantasy was that they were going to go somewhere together. They were in a car driving really fast and someone, he didn't know who, was chasing them. Said that it felt like an escape and he was laughing and smiling so big that it hurt. That they were just 2 ppl looking out for each other... His fantasy was identical to the ending. Does that prove it's not real? No.. he could have just got what he wanted and it's coincidence that it was an identical match to the description he gave in episode 6. Honestly IDC if it's reality or a simulation I absolutely loved it and boo-hooed like a baby!", "you explained this perfectly. i loved this show.", "I really love Jonah Hill and Emma Stone working together again after over ten years."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "A detailed analysis of Netflix's \"Maniac\" explaining the ending, easter eggs, and mysteries within!\n\nEpisode 1 Explained: "}
