These characters have been carefully crafted and are built to be multidimensional! I just watched episode 5, and, no spoilers, but the murders are great in the context of 80s slasher flicks, and the end of episode 4 added some of the supernatural element that brought Freddy and Jason to life repeatedly, so that's completely warranted. Also, it very could be a tie-in to Coven and/or Apocalypse.", "So here\u2019s my thought and theory. This for some reason reminds me of the Dallas episode where it was all a dream. I believe Margaret had some type of psychotic breakdown and is making the story up in her head.", "SCREAM IS NOT AN 80\u2019S SLASHER OMFG!\nMurderMotel is waaaaaay off, no lazy writing, this episode was excellent, just because a theory he heard was part of the plot doesn\u2019t make it predictable to anyone but himself. Several things have Happened that I theorized but it certainly didn\u2019t piss me off. "], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": ""}
