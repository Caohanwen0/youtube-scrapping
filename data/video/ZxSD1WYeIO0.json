I'm loving 911.  Can't get enough of it.  The character development is FANTASTIC too. \ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f", "I lived for 6 Feet Under... started watching that because of Frances Conroy and thankfully started watching (another one of my favorite shows of all time) Dexter, because of Michael C Hall.\n9-1-1 is fun, I really enjoy it but it\u2019s no AHS ;)", "The baby in the pipe was SCARY!! I lost it!!", "It's far fetched though about Connie Britton portrayed a 42 yr old woman.  Even when I first watched the pilot I had to rewind that scene in the very beginning when she states her \"age\".  Connie of Course in real life is 51 and clearly looks 51.  She has never done the Botox & Fillers like most gals w/ pillow face in Hollyweird tend to at her age, Thank God.\ud83d\ude4f\u271d\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f She still looks good though for her age, it's just 42 was obviously uncalled for when clearly she is not. \ud83d\ude0f"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "9-1-1 is a new show created and written by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Tim Minear.
