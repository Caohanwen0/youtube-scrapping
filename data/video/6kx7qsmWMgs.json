Kyle was such a tragic story, and some part of me hopes that somehow, some way, he can still help save the world.", "I kind of find Kyle's mom more villainous than some of the actual villain characters that were shown a lot more. I mean...their evilness is kind of expected of them? Like, take the current season for instance. Michael is the antichrist. Kyle's mother was just a disgusting human being who was supposed to take care of him.", "He reminds me so much of Tate in this scene xD"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGIQHvkZPzrna7UHtmlgoXw", "description": "American horror story coven - kyle flashback/ zoe and kyle scene \n3x6 the dead"}
