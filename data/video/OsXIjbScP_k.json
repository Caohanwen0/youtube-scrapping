Love his portrayal of Andy Warhol too!", "Ally, Beverly, and Kai are the only interesting characters this season; Meadow too, but she's dead now. Also, what is Kai up to with Bebe Babette. Did she lie about her story of joining a cult with Valerie Solanas, and being the ones who committed the Zodiac killings? Did she fabricate the story just to inspire Beverly, Ivy, and Winter to kill Harrison? Kai's motives are tediously confusing as to why he's obsessed Ally and rattling the female members of the Cult.", "\u2615\ufe0f", "\ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udd2b\ud83e\udd21\ud83d\udd2a\ud83c\udf39"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "Welcome to American Horror Story Weekly Wednesday Live Streams!
