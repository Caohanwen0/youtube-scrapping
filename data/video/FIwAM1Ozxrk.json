He goes from A to Z in one move. He sees the essence of everything before you can even finish the sentence.\n\nHow does he do it? Through observing reality and running it against his mental models. In this series of videos, you\u2019ll learn some of the most important models which Charlie Munger uses, which he has talked about publicly. These mental models have helped Munger to conquer the stock market, but they are so diverse that they have applications within many other areas too. For example, they have allowed Munger to be a successful Chairman at a large hospital, and they have allowed him to overcome devastating personal losses.\n\nThe series will cover a total of 35 of Charlie\u2019s mental models. He says he has some 100 models in his head at all times, but he also says that a few of them carry most of the freight. I think that we\u2019ll cover the most important ones in this series, which will be divided into 7 parts, will 5 models in each one. The models will primarily be related to investing, but also to associated subjects such as economics, entrepreneurship & career. Hope you enjoy.\n\nCan\u2019t get enough of mental models?
