Initially Reese is angry at Harold thinking he has made the changes, but Harold convinces him otherwise. It turns out that Owen Matthews (Samm Levine), a passenger on the plane is a witness being escorted by U.S. Marshals, and he is the intended target of multiple assassins including the ISA. After Reese foils several assassination attempts, Finch learns that one of the assassins plans to crash the aircraft and kill everyone onboard just to ensure the witness is eliminated. Reese and Harold safely land the plane and save everyone, and all ends well. Reese goes on a date with Holly (Sally Pressman), the flight attendant who helped him and later tells Harold he wants a new suit and to come back and work again.\n\nJanuary 14, 2014"}
