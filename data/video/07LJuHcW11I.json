Fine. And that\u2019s okay, if every episode is just as good or better I\u2019ll be very happy I just hope it doesn\u2019t get worse from here on out", "I'm just really annoyed they followed the general first season almost exactly. Murderer in the suit, a gay couple gets murdered, the parents are already dead like violet, psycho ghost who wants them to join them forever like tate, vengeful ghosts that didnt expect to be murdered like the group of girls. Like come ON, there was other things they really could've done but they really just copied it", "I absolutely loved when I heard young Adelaide\u2019s voice say \u201cyou\u2019re going to die in there.\u201d One of my favorite little scenes from Murder House. She is adorable.", "For having to wait over a wholeeeeeeee year,  I was very disappointed.
