Her son is devastated, Fusco lost a colleague who believed that he could be a good man.  Finch lost a friend who had helped him since he and Reese had started working.  Shaw has gone psychotic searching for her killer.   And Reese.....Reese has turned cold after this, wanting nothing but vengeance for his fallen friend. This is how characters should react, this really is great writing and filming, and not a single word was muttered", "They always choose the perfect music...", "This show is so underrated. Deserved many Emmys! ", "I love how we hear the monitor beeping at the beginning symbolizing John's survival and then at the end of the episode we see the monitor again except, this time, it's Simmons heartbeat and it flat-lines, signaling his death.
