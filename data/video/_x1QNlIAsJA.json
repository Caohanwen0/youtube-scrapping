Therefore Aziraphale was literally made for Crowley and they're perfect soulmates \ud83d\ude01", "I encountered a counter-headcanon and I love both and UGH SO TORN anyway\n\nAs the other headcanon goes, Crowley wasn't Raphael because there was no Raphael for ANYONE to be. However, Crowley's kindness caused him to be sometimes unable to resist the temptation to save people from harm. When they asked him what he should be called, he created the angelsona of Raphael, naming it after Aziraphale and I suppose he made it an Archangel because go big or go home I guess.", "All I know about Raphael is that he's gonna blow the horn at the start of judgement day and I've always joked that he'd play final countdown. If it was Crowley, he'd DEFINITELY play final countdown."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvp198WlRp6t72Rm5YXvOTw", "description": "Subscribe To Casually Comics -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKC..."}
