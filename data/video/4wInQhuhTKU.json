ESPECIALLY on today of all days.", "The episode was good but not my favourite. It felt too short and with 2 episodes left I don't want them to rush the ending. But I'll admit I loved seeing Venable she fully looked like Velma and Daphne if they had a child.", "The episode sounds shit; I'm really worried that season 8 is going to end in a HUGE anti-climax. 2 episodes left, yet we've barely scratched the surface. The first 2 episodes were a waste of time.", "Sounds like an underwhelming episode \nsmh"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nFX Plus: https://fxplus.fxnetworks.com"}
