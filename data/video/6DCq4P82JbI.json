But Claire is unaware that a private military firm from which she stole files for the game is after her to recover those documents. Several of their assassins are intercepted by Reese and Shaw just as they are about to kill Claire. Finch ultimately discovers that the Nautilus recruitment puzzle is being run by Samaritan. When Finch reaches out to her, warning against finishing the game, she does not listen and instead makes her way to the end of the game: the rooftop of a building in nautilus form. There, she is held at gunpoint by Silverpool operatives. Believing the game to be a lie, Claire hands over the documents, only to see the operatives are shot dead by unseen snipers. Before she can react, she discovers a phone on which Samaritan reveals its presence and recognizes her as an asset. Through Claire's documents, Silverpool's atrocities are exposed, as is a Silverpool threat identification program that would have competed with Samaritan. Later that night, Finch reveals the new base of operations to Reese and Shaw, telling them that he is back to help in the fight against Samaritan.\n\nSeptember 30, 2014"}
