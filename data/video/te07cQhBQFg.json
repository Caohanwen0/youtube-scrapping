In a way, Jessica really did pass the series over to Sarah.", "What I love about this scene is that it's not some cheesy, unrealistic kiss and makeup scene. Fiona and Cordelia had some real issues. I think Fiona finally opening up to Cordelia and telling her that every time she looked at her, she saw her own demise and that's why she resented her gave Cordelia the answer she always searched for. Which then, Cordelia tells her that it's okay to be afraid. Them hugging and gaining an understanding of each other just moments before Fiona took her last breath is beautiful.", "\"You took my power the minute I gave birth to you. When a woman becomes a mother, she can't help but see her own mortality in that cherubic little face.\" Wow, that's such a human line. Having a child is like watching the last of your innocence being deposited in a tiny vessel. That's why we protect them so dearly, why losing them leaves us in total darkness.", "\"A divine being finally having a human experience. \""], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGIQHvkZPzrna7UHtmlgoXw", "description": "American horror story coven - Cordelia and Fiona talk for the last time.\n3x13 the seven wonders"}
