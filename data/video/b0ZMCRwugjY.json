It's an awesome movie.  Sarah Paulson played Xandra really well.  I just wish she'd been in it more.  Anything with Queen Sarah is worth watching.  Oh!  I bought it on DVD on Amazon last week.  Now I'm just waiting for it to get here.  It'll be my fourth DVD with Sarah. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95", "OMG TYSM!!\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_o7dc8GMa7l8V4duwpfxXQ", "description": "\u2022MEGA LINK\u2022 \nhttps://mega.nz/file/k3QyGLjS#u1K4BgS..."}
