This montage was done with emotion, even if it is somehow a tribute that I gave him, know that he's always there Jim! Feel free to show him if you see one day. Thanks again the Reese Team!", "Extremely well done. It is his(Jim Caviezel's) voice more than any thing else that gets me. That and his eyes. Those windows have a voice that can send you in so many directions. He can awaken so many things hidden deep in your heart and soul. So inspiring.", "Great work MFBA - Congratulations and thank you !", "Jim is an emotional person, His voice trembled in his testimony and his roles in his movies are  almost all as he feels deeply in his heart and soul, with some exceptions that make the rule as it is said.  You show him exactly in your video and I thank you for your beautiful work. You know I red awful things about him on Internet, success makes ennemies and he has huge ennemies around him. But God is protecting him and his family. God bless you all.", "A strong and living video, a tremendous tribute to Jim Caviezel. I love it. I remember the link to show him in case..."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8K1-uC3NazkioWBnDk_5w", "description": "Montage for Jim Caviezel, created by me\n\nSong: \nX Ray Dog Overcome : "}
