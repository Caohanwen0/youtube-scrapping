And this is MY fucking house.\"", "The worst part about that random baby being the 'spawn of satan' in the end is that it completely goes against what was said in Murder House. The only reason Langdon was satan's spawn was because he was the conceived from a living and a dead person", "Apocalypse it's a mess, yeah. But they bring back Jessica Lange and I love every second of her, so... I would rewatch the entire season just to see five minutes or less of her? Absolutely yes.", "Coven had style and the story was fresh. Apocalypse is goofy and the writing is horrifically bad."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChc-m3saf8K2oJHDSsnsj_A", "description": "American Horror Story bad\n\nAyylien Clothing \u25ba https://ayylienclothing.com"}
