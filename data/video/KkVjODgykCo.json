Kinda like the horrors of what goes on in Handmaid's Tale. Big Brother is watching yada, yada.  \ud83d\udc4d", "The symbolism of the teeth rain in Roanoke flew over the heads of 99.9% of the audience. There was pig/wild boar imagery throughout the season, and teeth are the only part of a body that pigs cannot digest. The significance of the teeth is to show how many victims the Butcher and Scathach have claimed in their worship of their dark gods. In episode 4(I think it was 4) the Butcher says she sent the teeth storm as a warning to them to leave the land before the blood moon or be added to the collection.", "We haven\u2019t had Bigfoot! The most American \u201cmonster\u201d out there & he would fit in with a camp in the woods setting. Or Creature From The Black Lagoon Who we saw in a false teaser for Roanoke, I\u2019d love to see him POP right out of the \u201cCrystal Lake\u201d too.", "I think they\u2019re going to have all the younger stars plus a bunch of new faces. All the under 30\u2019s will play teenagers and this is RPM\u2019s version of Camp Crystal Lake... hopefully we revisit hillbilly land & our old friends the Polks will be the slashers in this story. I want Snows & bastard Motts in this story too!", "Glad your back beautiful"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "Welcome to American Horror Story Weekly Wednesday Live Stream!
