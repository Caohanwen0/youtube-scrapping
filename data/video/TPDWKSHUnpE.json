Asylum is just the absolute peak to me.", "Freak Show is such an underrated season. It's so psychologically disturbing and creative with amazing characters and a nice vibe, beautiful location, amazing music, interesting storyline and an incredible ending. The ending is probably one of my favourite moments from the season; dare I say my favourite season finale. Beautifully done. I cried multiple times this season and it's the type of season I could rewatch a dozen times and not get tired of. It's my favourite season too, with Asylum coming in at second place; but out of all of them, this one holds a special place in my heart.", "I actually think the themes in Cult were terrifying. Charisma and how these narcissistic or psychopathic individuals can manipulate us and draw us in is horrifying.", "I would definitely say the Coven slavery/Delphine storyline (which is historically accurate) is pretty damn horrific...", "Cult is the most underrated season by far Evan Peters did such a great job and so did Sarah Paulson and the plot twist near the end was very unexpected while roanoke pretty much did the same thing twice in that season"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-exz3M1efabysAyd90ekNQ", "description": "make sure you're staying inside as much as possible right now and while you're at it, watch my other video on every killer portrayed in american horror story! https://youtu.be/mp5b9BnIkIo"}
