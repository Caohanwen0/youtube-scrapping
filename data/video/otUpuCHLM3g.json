Nice to see the face behind the voice (Pose Reviews). I'm so looking forward to the premiere of AHS 8--even though it's in two months. But your excitement  is so contagious. I. Am. So. Chuffed. Thank you for your videos. Did you say you did a theory video about Charles Montgomery and Madison Montgomery. Hope Misty Day comes back.", "You are beautiful!  Thank you for your videos!", "Damn! I missed the livestream, because I was talking with my fianc\u00e9.", "I feel like season 8 is gonna still have the futuristic theme in it and the coven crossover isnt going to be the main theme of it but its gonna revolve around it.  The scene with billy erection and people running away. Maybe something does happen in the first episode or so and the cross over is gonna be revolve around it but the theme still has still futuristic catastrophic theme. OOOH and whatever this \"being\" or \"situation\" thats caused that issue is what Cordelia's going to be dealing with thats trying to take her down. hehe", "In think my theory about their being paranormal investigators is correct. AHS Leaks just showed an exhibit  of things called Eccentricities. Maybe the season will be about a supernatural collectors or investigators who gather paranormal evidence and creatures. I hope the title for this season is American Horror Story: Occult"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nWelcome to American Horror Story Weekly Wednesday Live Stream!
