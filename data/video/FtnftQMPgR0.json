Ally definitely may have carried Ivy\u2019s egg... and who\u2019s sperm!? Dun dun dun! Is Kai the donor and that\u2019s why he\u2019s watched Ally for so long?\nI still think Ally will sacrifice herself for Oz... \u201clove story for the ages\u201d is still sticking out to me, this is sooo Candyman #BeesAreTheFirstCult", "I agree this episode was great this season is one of my favorites. I too want to see one of the unedited version. The scene with Kai and Meadows was hot but disturbing. Tell Casey I also have raisins on my dresser. They are very good, but I only eat a few. Great live stream. I'm going to Gaga too!", "This stream cut out on me so bad last night, I only connected twice for a minute... but the episode was sooo good! The unedited version is AWESOME! \nI really wanted to talk to y\u2019all on stream but oh well, hopefully at see you at 9 Mary ;)", "Happy B Day Casey! Hope you had a great one :D", "these last two episodes restored my faith in the show, but it's ludicrous for them to expect people to wait over a month into a show for it to be good\n\ni'm on the rare side of people who didn't love the season, but it's gaining speed, sad it's almost over now "], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "VIDEO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR American Horror Story, Season 7, Episode 6!!!\n\nBeyond the Horror: Cult, is an unofficial American Horror Story Live After Show.
