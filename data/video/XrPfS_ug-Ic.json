She\u2019s a good character, but I don\u2019t love her. I find it really difficult to sympathize with cheaters and she\u2019s clearly established as one. Not to mention she\u2019s addicted to pills. I definitely understand she\u2019s mourning her son, but she\u2019s also neglecting her daughter at the same time.", "What about officer daniel rigg he was a good character to me and one of my favorites I know he technically killed eric Matthews", "Its a shame that she died she could have been a intressest character since she knows  doctor gordon", "Yo real talk I know you are a die hard saw fan if you can reply with a update on the new saw film \u201cspiral \u201c I need to know when it\u2019s coming out."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4GPRqEoZ4zpnTHIxcG5JyQ", "description": "Top 9 Best SAW Characters #6 | SAW-Tober 2020\n\nJigsawRules:"}
