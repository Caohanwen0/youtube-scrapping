It's amazing how accurate this show is even to present day (2021) with its political subplots and obviously the technological aspect", "I'd love to see a Spin off where we follow Root, she did so much off screen with the machine... I'd love to see that!", "2020 and still great viewing.  Needs an extended version through to season 5, episode 13.  More timeline effects and those epic action scenes.", "PLEASE make an updated one! This is so good! (P.S. You should use some Machine and Samaritan themes and timeline effects!)", "Making me feel extremely nostalgic. Such good writing."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOc2a5s7lGlPjwGsSWJb4g", "description": "A thingy I made for a fan party."}
