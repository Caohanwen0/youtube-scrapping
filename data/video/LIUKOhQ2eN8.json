I\u2019m LOVING this show!", "Are you going to do more episodes? I just starting watching.", "I would love to see MJ Rodgriguez, Indya Moore, and Ryan Jamaal Swain jump around the Murphy-verse.  They are getting the initial push into the spot light, and if they can deliver like they have already and apply that to roles outside of their social bubble would be huge! Fingers crossed this gets picked up for a season 2 and MJ being cast in a season of AHS. Could also see her being able to do a heavy drama like 911 too. OMG imagine a witches council with Leslie Jordan AND Billy Porter... I'd fucking die of happiness!!!", "Please do more reviews soon on pose\ud83d\ude2d we need them"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nMARY'S BOOKS & THANGS:\n--website: www.maryannmoody.us\n--Patreon: "}
