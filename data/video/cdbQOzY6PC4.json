It's the best show I've ever seen! My husband and I watch it on netflix! Never saw it on regular tv. I would be so devistated if it went off the air. I can't believe CBS doesn't want to continue it, but someone will pick it up, I'm sure of it! You need to watch it more than once, because I noticed I missed a lot of stuff when only watching it once!", "The best show ever, I am currently watching season 1 for now, I think I moght able to catch up to season 4", "This show and house of cards really shocked me as to how good they both were! I binged on them both, can't wait for s4 "], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "description": "Get a look at what's to come, straight from New York Comic Con"}
