When she was bringing back the warlock- she had a laurel around her head instead of wearing a witches hat. That is extremely significant as most gods/goddess have laurels in the style of hers. She\u2019s the opposite version of Michael - she was conceived in a pure way more than likely whereas Michael was conceived in a place and way of evil.. as we saw in season one.", "Did anyone notice that Bubbles movie mentions the Briarcliff assylum in season 2?", "did anyone else notice that mallory actually completed the 7 wonders?! bringing back john was the final test and they named her supreme", "I kept denying that mallory was the supreme bc i thought it would be too obvious. however, this last episode made me realize that even if it was obvious, this season\u2019s mystery isn\u2019t about who the supreme is lol it\u2019s about how they\u2019re gonna save the world. so now i\u2019m rooting to mallory haha"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nFX Plus: https://fxplus.fxnetworks.com"}
