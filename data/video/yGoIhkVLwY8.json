Why end a fantastic series and continue the crappy ones!! CBS, shame on you!", "Ok, I was not ready for this, and I already cried... I'm in shock and I'm afraid. The Finch/Reese scene is just beautiful and sad and...my heart is broken. \nThis episode is going to be a hell of a one, and sad and all. I'm not prepared to let it go... I so love that show which was one of the most intense and awesome I've ever saw!", "Simply thank you, this has been a great story, and, as it, it will live forever in our hearts. This is the story of television.", "\"Harooold !\" This episode is gonna be great", "The more I see this finale, the lack of giving POI a full season send \noff, and most importantly how brilliant this series was written and \nacted.
