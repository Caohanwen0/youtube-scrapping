I absolutely adore these two characters! I just finished Good Omens (for the second time) and still cannot get enough! David Tennant and Michael Sheen's chemistry as Crowley and Aziraphale is undeniable and no one could have done a better job! Congrats to the cast and crew for an ineffable mini-series. Fantastic! Thank you to Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett (RIP) for creating these characters! Per the usual, I do not own the song nor the rights to the show, just the editing.\n\nSong: Rewrite the Stars by Pasek and Paul, performed by Zac Efron and Zendaya in \"The Greatest Showman\""}
