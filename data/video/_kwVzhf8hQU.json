These girls and they're guns. ", "I love how Shaw is such a little fangirl with the guns....and so generous too...\"Oh you can borrow it anytime\". She must really like Carter.", "I LOVE how excited Shaw is about showing her gun to Carter and how she then gets kind of flustered by her own enthusiasm and how quickly she offers to lend the gun to Carter. Taken together with the later scenes where Shaw happily provides a grenade launcher and subsequently is super proud (and I'd guess more than a little aroused) when she sees Carter using the weapon, this made me totally ship Shaw/Carter.", "The chemistry between the three of them was awesome.", "So firearms is what gets Shaw to open up and be friendly huh? Look at the excitement on her normally deadpan face! This scene was totally hilarious. Instead of the usual lip balm, keys and mints, these women are packing heat in their purses.
