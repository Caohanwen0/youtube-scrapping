The second, I realized you meant it literally.  :)", "i have *never* dropped  my copy of good omens in the bath. however, all its corners are somewhat rounded from carrying it in my bag, and it has more than a few food stains... :)", "Jill, have you seen the BBC / Amazon adaptation of Good Omens? They got it almost perfect. I kinda missed the Greasy Johnson & the Johnsonites. It didn't have a huge impact, but the line in the last episode about how's gang is best when Adam is talking to Gabe and Beelzebub seems out of place. It makes sense in the book because part of the story involves Greasy Johnson and his gang and when Adam realises he's got to fix the world not remake it, he understands that the world won't be better without a rival gang.", "Coming back to this after just binging the new Amazon/BBC miniseries. So good. Would love to see your take on it!", "Thank you for that.....I haven't read the book, but I've just watched the Amazon Good Omens series, and it was fantastic!! I now want to read the book!
