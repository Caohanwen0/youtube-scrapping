You\u2019re absolutely right I did.", "This probably the closest thing I\u2019m every going to get to having Doctor Who show up in Supernatural, isn\u2019t it?", "Tennant in ginger. I REPEAT THE DOCTOR IS GINGER !", "I still fondly remember meeting Pratchett and Gaiman in London during a book signing of this and Pratchett's Reaper Man. Gaiman was clad, as usual, in leather jacket and shades and seemed a little less talkative than Pratchett who was absolutely everything and more I'd hoped one of my lifelong idols would be. He took the time to ask where I'd travelled from, my name, favourite Discworld character and didn't simply move on to the next person in the queue when I blurted out a somewhat incomprehensible stream of gibberish waffle as everything I'd planned to ask him vacated my mind in a moment of panic and left me acting more like a confused orangutan than the verbose, eloquent and intellectual young whipper snapper I'd hoped to present him with. Suffice to say I feel blessed that I got to meet the literary legend during mine and his lifetime and it's a memory I'll always cherish.
