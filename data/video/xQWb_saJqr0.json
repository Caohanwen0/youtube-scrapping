I knew I was forgetting something...\n\nNew show! Person of Interest was freaking EPIC! If you haven't seen the show, go now and watch it, fantastic show, two excellent leads and a pretty intriguing concept (rather like The Minority Report meets Batman Begins, seriously, Reese even LOOKS like Christian Bale when he's got the beard and the stories are pretty similar) anyways, excellent show, couldn't wait to vid it, so, didn't spend long on this but it turned out pretty well :)\n\nI know, the whole putting the lyrics on the video is pretty clich\u00e9 for this song, but, it looks good so I'm not changing it.\n\nPrime Suspect video coming up!\n\nPerson of Interest airs 9\\8c Thursday's on CBS (Watch it!)\n\nSong info at the end (I've said this before, i don't like rap, but I do like this chorus, the only part of the song I like)\n\nBackUp: "}
