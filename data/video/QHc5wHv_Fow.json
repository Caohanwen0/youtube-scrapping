Unlike the previous installment (Dexter vs. Breaking Bad), I did not have a definitive winner in mind for this video as I'm a huge fan of both shows. That means you can take the conclusion with a grain of salt - the \"winner\" kept on switching, depending on the ridiculous categories I decided to include. In case it's not obvious already; yes, the scenes and categories were specifically selected to show the contrast between the two shows. Have fun, enjoy and beware of spoilers!\n\nSide note; this video was finished before the series finale of Person Of Interest."}
