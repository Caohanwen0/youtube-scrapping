In the present day, the Machine gives Finch and Reese the number of Alex Duncan (Stephen Plunkett), who turns out to be the brother of that soldier, and who has found himself in trouble with the CIA by investigating his brother's death, since doing so could expose an off-books operation, threatening the careers of the powers that be within the Agency. Reese rescues Duncan from his old boss, Terrance Beale (Keith David), the very same agent who sent Reese and Kara to kill Duncan's brother and they lie to Duncan about his brother's death; Reese leaves on good terms with Beale, who agrees to keep the fact that Reese is still alive a secret. Meanwhile, Finch and Root investigate malware that Samaritan has been using to infect the firmware of electronic devices, and, prompted by a message from the Machine, Root runs the malware on an airgapped laptop disconnected from any external sources. Reese decides he can no longer see Dr. Iris Campbell for the time being, claiming that he is unable to lead a \"normal life\", after which he receives another number from Finch.\n\nMay 10, 2016"}
