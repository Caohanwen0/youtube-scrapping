To prove that Denton is \"bad code\", she allows Finch to help Denton temporarily escape and pretends to be subdued. Once Denton realizes that Finch was involved with the creation of the Machine, he tries to kill Finch, but Root kills Denton instead after he reveals the Machine's location to be somewhere in Salt Lake City. Meanwhile, Reese continues to follow the trail of the missing girl supplied by the Machine in \"The Contingency\". Her name was Hanna Frey, a girl abducted outside a library. The one witness to the crime was Hanna's friend Samantha Groves, who informed the librarian (Margo Martindale) what she saw, only for the librarian to accuse Sam of lying, because she was in love with the man that Sam had accused. The experience started Sam down a path that would ultimately lead to her becoming Root. Now knowing Root's real name, Reese is able to track her movements through bank accounts, to triangulate Weeks' location. He arrives in time to find Weeks dead and Root gone, having taken Finch with her to Union Station. Finch leaves a clue to where he is being taken by using a tap code on a telephone handset. Reese decodes the clue in order to follow and save Finch, but Root is able to escape before Reese can apprehend her.\n\nOctober 4, 2012\n\n+128"}
