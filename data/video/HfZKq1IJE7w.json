I had kind of accepted his passing a long time ago... but when it finally happened it fucking crushed me. I think the emotional weight comes from the whole way the episode was orchestrated. We see a young Reese mourning for his father, and a man tells his mother that his father was a \"hero who went back and saved four.\" ", "who else just cried and cried throughout this episode and just couldn't stop even after it had finished, I have never been so emotional over a tv show before, I just can't believe it's gone, I can't believe I'll never see any of the characters again, I can't believe I'll never see a new episode of person of interest ever again.
