So I've just discovered something pretty interesting that I'm confused about, I was looking at the sweet dreams ocean video that AHS posted after the finale of Roanoke and just above FX it says: Wed 10?? Why would they have Wednesday the 10th added there? Now the next Wednesday the 10th is in may this year but I know Ryan said they start filming in June but maybe he is fooling us and they start filming for season 8 in June and might get 2 seasons this year which is why Roanoke was shorter in episodes, also someone stated that sweet dreams could be related to the sweet dreams song (travel the world and the seven seas) 7th season cruise theme maybe and Ryan is tricking us with the election theme, just a thought", "Vivian wasn't giving it up for over a year !!!", "Michael was born in 1997? I thought Murder House was set in 2011", "Politics can be very scary!!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "VIDEO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR SEASON ONE, EPISODE 5 OF AMERICAN HORROR STORY!!!\n\nBeyond the Horror: Murder House, is an unofficial American Horror Story Live After Show.
