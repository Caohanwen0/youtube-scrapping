Although he was regarded as a criminal, he fought for people and eliminated those who are actual criminals like the 5 Mafia head families who are truly criminals. Elias created good through evil, he was never a bad guy to me. RIP Elias", "I was as shocked as Finch when I first saw Elias die. His death was WAY too quick and unexpected", "I liked Elias too.  He had his own weird ideas of order and loyalty, but he had morals.  And Enrico played him to perfection.  Too bad all the interesting characters on the show got killed off.", "The small details like Finch kneeling down to check on Carl despite clearly seeing the killshot to his head and then Reese removing his eyeglasses and closing his eyes show a great deal of respect for him.", "Elias died protecting his last friend...goodbye Elias..."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF3kXXD7_C8T_I4gMrfSuAQ", "description": "Carl Elias - Enrico Colantoni\nJohn Reese - Jim Cavizel\nHarold Finch - Michael Emerson\nLionel Fusco - Kevin Chapman"}
