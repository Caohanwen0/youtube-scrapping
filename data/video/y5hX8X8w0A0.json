Hill House was one of the most well made great supernatural and or haunted house TV shows I've ever seen, if it's the same writers and actors coming back like AHS does with each new season being about a different haunted house from classic gothic horror novels than I'm definitely watching.", "Thank gos they're not using the Crains it was the best decision ever cause their story is over ! I'm really happy that this series turns out to become an anthology like American horror story it was the best choice for this series ^^", "What if Hill House was Bly Manor before the Hills claimed ownership? Because more people died in Hill House than just the Hills, Olivia, and Abigail. Because we see like 20 other spirits in the background when Steve is walking out of the house at the end. So if Hill house and Bly Manor really are the same place that can be a chance to introduce more ghosts and reveal more history of the place.", "It's already 2020. Does Netflix think that releasing Haunting s2 will be too scary for viewers during the coronavirus?", "Can't wait .... One of the best 2018 series"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "In this video we break down everything there is to know about season 2 of \"The Haunting of Hill House\" also known as, \"The Haunting of Bly House.\"\n\nLink to Haunting's Teaser Video: "}
