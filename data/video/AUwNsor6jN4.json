Elias played both John and us, the viewers, perfectly. I just love how dignified and polite he remains after the reveal, hinting that there's a decent guy who's been through Hell and back still in there, but one that's willing to do anything to get what he wants.", "\u201cI thought about killing you John. But then I realized that would seem ungrateful. Besides, how do you kill someone so talented?\u201d", "The moment POI pulled a \"Usual Suspects\" and this kind hearted professor revealed himself as one of the best criminal masterminds on TV, it was the moment Person Of Interest became one of the best TV shows ever.", "After all these years and I say it again and I will say it always: when will drama makers make a legendary series like this again?", "Carl Elias was one of the most interesting characters ever seen on a TV \nscreen. He was devilish and intriguing at the same time. Even after five years, there was still a lot to learn about him. After John and Carter, Elias was my favorite character on POI. I really miss POI, my all-time favorite tv show."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_n9HC4_nauZgeANSpXP_Q", "description": "Charlie Burton is revealed to be Elias to John and Harold as well as the NYPD.\n\nAll rights of Person of Interest go to its creators and distributors, not to me, no copyright infringement is intended."}
