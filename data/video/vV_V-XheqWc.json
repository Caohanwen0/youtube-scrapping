He\u2019s Harry? As a writer, it\u2019s hard to express what\u2019s evocative (I laughed so hard at the Joachin Phoenix scene!), but agree that he should somehow be showing it. I wish this series - which I am really engaged with - were a full 12 episodes so it had room to explore a bit more.", "The guy who is losing hair is becoming a Pale and he might be the one at the graveyard. Pales' teeth are filed al the way to the gums, but those who have Lark's teeth only had their teeth filed half way.", "There are a LOT of people who think they are talented when they aren't. So I can totally believe talentless people taking the pill, knowing the side effects. They THINK they have talent.", "Well, I mean, when Ursula was quoting what \u201cQuentin\u201d had to say to Harry. Pretty much alludes that he himself takes the pills but can\u2019t because he\u2019s newly married and is focusing on that for the time being and then direct whatever Harry writes."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4GPRqEoZ4zpnTHIxcG5JyQ", "description": "American Horror Story: Double Feature Episode 4 Teaser Breakdown!
