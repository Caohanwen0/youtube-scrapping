They learn that she is being targeted because she expressed concern over the results VAL, a mobile app designed to aid users, is giving to people with depression that has resulted in suicides. However, Finch discovers a nautilus during the investigation and is contacted by Claire Mahoney who tries to convince him that he was right all along about the people who created the nautilus game. When Finch tells her about Samaritan, she tells him that she had recovered some source code from it and wants him to use it on his laptop, but he's suspicious. Claire reveals herself to be an agent working for Samaritan and leads Finch at gunpoint to a school run by Samaritan and attempts to recruit him, but he refuses. Root rescues him from the agents and shoots Claire, who later returns and hands Finch's laptop to Greer who has it analyzed. Back at Fetch and Retrieve, Calvin Mazer holds Fusco and Anna at gunpoint and reveals to them that he was the one who ordered that VAL's source code be altered to target people with depression, gambling problems and debt, for the sake of the advertisers. Reese rescues them, and Calvin is arrested by Fusco. The next day, Greer attends a board meeting at Fetch and Retrieve and greets the CEO, Lauren Buchanan, and offers them a solution to their problems.\n\nFebruary 17, 2015"}
