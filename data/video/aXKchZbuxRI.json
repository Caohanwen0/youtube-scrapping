And in my opinion, Denise The wrote one of the very best episodes of the entire series with 6,741.  I believe she also wrote the series' Finale with Jonah Nolan.", "Oh my God I CAN'T WAIT for season 5! :D\nShaw and Root reunion - oh God YES :D\nGREAT SHOW GREAT CAST!\nLOVE AMY :D LOOOOVE ROOT <3", "I never realized this until just now after I looked it up on IMDB, and maybe someone can tell me what happened, and why.  I know that after Amy became a regular on PoI(starting in Season 3) that she missed a few episodes in both Season 3 and 4, but I just checked and it appears that she missed exactly five episodes in each season where she was simply listed as \"credit only\".  It seems too much of a coincidence to me that she missed exactly five episodes in Season 3 as well as in Season 4, so I wonder if someone knows what happened?  Ummm... my apologies, after a closer look it appears that she actually missed six episodes in Season 3(which had 23 episodes), and five episodes in Season 4(which had 22 episodes), but in my view it still seems far too orderly to be completely coincidental.
