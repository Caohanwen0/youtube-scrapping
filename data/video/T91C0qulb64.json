Following a robbery at a museum exhibition, Shaw investigates Kelli's house and learns that her next operation is to steal a Gutenberg Bible that is being shipped out that night. Shaw is able to foil the plan but is confronted by Kelli, whose boss Cyril (Gene Farber) is an extortionist revealed to be forcing Kelli to commit robberies while her daughter is kept kidnapped. The team learns that the Bible is being kept in a heavily guarded building belonging to a company called Symmetric Security. Fusco obtains the fingerprints of a guard there while Finch uses a 3D printer to create a fake hand with the guard's fingerprints. That night at the Symmetric Security headquarters, Reese distracts the guards by setting off the alarms in the building, allowing Shaw and Kelli to use the fingerprints to access the room containing the Bible. Kelli uses her gymnastics skills to bypass the proximity detectors and steal the Bible. Finch takes Interpol agent Alain Bouchard (Henri Lubatti), the man in charge of the investigation against Kelli, and they listen in on Kelli's conversation with Cyril so Bouchard can learn the truth. Cyril refuses to free Kelli's daughter, but when he accesses the surveillance feed on her, he sees Reese take down the thugs guarding the girl. Shaw shoots Cyril in the leg before he can kill Kelli and both Kelli and Cyril are apprehended. In an interrogation room at the NYPD, Bouchard tells Kelli that her life before being a criminal was a shame and that she deserved the gold medal. He places a key on a desk, allowing her to leave. The next day, Kelli and her daughter happily reunite after Reese's rescue. That night, the team celebrates their victory and Reese honors Carter by pouring a glass for their \"missing member\".\n\nFebruary 4, 2014"}
