That makes me soooo efffing excited! I think for once this will be a newer season that is totally for \u201c the fans\u201d , and it\u2019s about time. Ryan\u2019s best work is in the earlier seasons and i think they are the most popular, can\u2019t wait! When Roanoke came out it was on my 17th birthday and i was sooo disappointed! I hope this season brings back fans that fell in love with the fantasy style of the first 3 seasons! ", "Its like a demonic Apocalypse. Omggg how cooooool. Im soooo gonna love this season so much.", "I think the hand and the arm texture almost looks like the devil, and it would fit a satanic 'apocalypse' theme concerning Michael Langdon", "Do you think they'll ever explain how there are so many God's in the AHS universe?
