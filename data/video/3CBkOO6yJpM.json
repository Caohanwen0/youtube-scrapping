That\u2019s such a reference to Adam and Eve considering Michael probably left it for them.", "Insanely meta how Langdon asks Evan peters if he will tell him \u201cwho he really is\u201d and jokes about his leather fascination... like he reminds him of his father or something... idk it\u2019s really odd. As if the antichrist himself knows Evan peters plays two people\ud83d\ude02 even tells Venable he feels like he knows Gallant..", "The scene where the two looks at Michael's computer gave me SERIOUS Adam and Eve vibes. Laid out perfectly on the bed was a glowing computer, taunting the two to see what it was, knowing that they weren't supposed to look at it. Was it a coincidence that the computer was an Apple product? The \"forbidden fruit\" that Lucifer used in the Garden of Eden?", "Stevie playing has to be sign of coven tho", "I think Michael is an unreliable character. So everything he says or does shouldn't be consider either true or false, this includes whatever he leaves behind \"as clue\". The emails could be staged or even an illusion  (he's that powerful) OR they could be true (either way shouldn't be taken 100%, since he's playing EVERYONE)"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nImages by Danny Vera.
