He did not need to know who samaritan was but throughout he's research studying the world, he saw that something Fundamental (huge) has changed\u2026 (Theft, Drugs, Bank Robbery\u2026 All were being grabbed by samaritan all around the world without people being able to trace whats going on) (Something Has Changed! Something Fundamental!) \n\nElias is Very smart!\u2026 All he knew was something has Changed and out of all the people he was the first one to work it out\u2026 He was not as smart as samaritan but it makes me wonder who would win a chess match between him and Harold lol"}
