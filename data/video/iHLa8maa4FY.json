I love horror films & tv shows. But, have never been that big into slasher films, where it's just someone running around killing people, and seeing the different ways they each die. I love horror, that has a supernatural element, like witches, demons, vampires, ghosts, etc. But, I still gave this season a chance and have been watching it. The first few episodes didn't interest me that much. But, the last 2 episodes have changed my mind. Now, that it turns out that the characters are ghosts, I'm suddenly totally into it!", "The ghosts should get revenge on Margaret by killing her"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": ""}
