Abs or no abs?", "It's sad how under utilized Zac Efron has been as an actor. I realize he has had some decent size parts, but he is so much more than just the quintessential \"girl crush\" as he has been portrayed in many movies, save this one. His acting ability really reveals itself in this movie.", "I do wish they showed the murders but i like how they shot it from liz\u2019s view because its one of the only pieces on him that show how normal and human he appeared", "I was present for the 1979 Chi Omega trials and had an actual one on one conversation with Ted in 1983 while getting my degree in Law Enforcement/Criminal Justice. To be perfectly honest if you didn't have any evidence and just heard Ted talk or had a conversation with him you'd be 110% convinced he was absolutely innocent. The way he interacted with people is on par with someone like Robert Downey Jr. He absolutely oozed charisma and charm. I think Zac Efron nailed his portrayal of Ted in this movie albeit for the few scenes when Ted cried. Ted never once shed a single tear, never looked suprised, even when he heard that guilty verdict he remained cool as a cucumber.", "It should have been a mini series.  There is way to much background/facts with Bundy."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "In this video we look at Netflix's latest biopic \"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile\" to see how Zac Efron's Ted Bundy compares to the real life story.
