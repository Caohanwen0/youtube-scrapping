[0:21] \"We don't\" was perfect.\nThough I agree that The First Season Intro was better due to more depth, thus creating a slightly longer introduction. \nWell, like you don't judge a Book by it's Cover, you also don't judge a TV Series by it's Intro. Such an amazing show.", "2019, and this thing is now real.", "Disagree. I much prefer season 2's intro, especially the way it shuffles through the images of all the characters as Finch is explaining what they do. I think that at this point in the series, there's no need to mention that Finch built the machine because they make the fact clear in almost every episode.", "i honestly love both seasons. baby blues was my favorite episode.", "J'adore cette serie... tres bonne saison et \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent la saison 2.... yes!!!
