This covers episodes 1-9, I included not only direct interaction with Carter and Reese but also scenes where they talk to other characters about each other. There were a couple of instances where Carter briefly mentions \"The Man in the Suit\", I did not put all of them in because they were only 1 or two seconds and very unimportant.\n\nPart 2 of season 1 will be up soon, and season 2 should be up in a couple of weeks.\n\nEnjoy!!!!"}
