Such a shame it was not on the original soundtrack released.", "I'm assuming that the Samaritan's animation sounds that plays besides the music at the end are on the left and right channels and you can't remove it am I right?", "I RECOGNIZE THAT FONT!

This is the \"Listening With A Million Ears\" version of the Samaritan theme we've all been waiting for (3:27). It's so epic, it even has a choir.
