I LOVED the vampires of hotel and the aliens of Asylum. I hope they do something with werewolves or urban legends just to give it a twist. I would also like to see sexy Scathach make another appearance.", "I have two theories:\n\n1) 1984 ties into Asylum by way of Kit\u2019s children. Kit was likely around 25 years old in 1964 when his children were born and developed pancreatic cancer at 40 and then died. That means he died in roughly 1979 making his children 15 years old when their father died. Lana Winters in the season 2 finale says his kids wanted to come home to take care of him, which means they were away somewhere. They may have been at Camp Redwood or another location, who knows. ", "I liked the theories...except for the Mary  Eunice one. I\u2019d rather have a more traditional kind of 80s slasher than a season with demonic possession"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "There's a rumor #AHS1984 will connect to AHS Asylum.
