With the Dark Ones killing Ruby, it looks like she's dead for good now. And Ruby is a main character, and It took her 3 seasons to actually, truly die. I hope Kelly survives at least, but it wont be surprising if she's dead for good too. I hope I didn't spoil anything for people who didn't watch last 9 episodes of season 3(sorry if I did)", "Hail to the king baby...give me some sugar.
