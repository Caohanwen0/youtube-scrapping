My bad.", "I wonder what its like for Evan and Frances to get a new season. They must be like omg yes bring it on lol lol", "I really dislike the child actor, I had high hopes but the \"Dad im hungry now\" line nailed it in the coffin for me, I hope they throw her in da ocean", "I wonder whos going to kill the police chief? It didnt look like anyone fed on her in the clips", "I forgot about Let the right one in, read the book and watched both movies.
