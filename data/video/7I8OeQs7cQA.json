It's too brilliant, too suspenseful and too smart. The general tv public is too interested in b.s. reality tv, Kardashian crap or \"another NCIS\". \n\nThis is the greatest TV show in the last 20 years -- on par with \"The XFiles\", the Battlestar reboot from Sci-Fi, and  Lost (season 1-3 only).", "Screw the Walking Dead, Game of Thrones and all the other overrated shows on at the moment, THIS is where my hype is.", "This show needs to go down in history. It's incredible and I can't believe it's been cancelled so soon :(", "A show where every episode feels like a movie and CBS called it off? It's a shame.
