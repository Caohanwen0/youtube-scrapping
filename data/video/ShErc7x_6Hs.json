I squeaked when i saw this in my recommended videos and hoped it would be this! And the clips line up so perfectly!", "Loving the syncing of lyrics! \nAnd way you placed the scenes, also that \u2018the air was so hot\u2019 was smart.", "Maybe do one with the song stand by you just cause every lyric matches. Beautiful about angels demons and wings and being with each other", "so love this video it so good", "If you like Crowley (dancing is not a crime misheard lyric)"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-WsrPUzcMeStQZh1kqBL2Q", "description": "-Who doesn't want to love an angel and a demon?-\nI never thought I could love something so much, but Good Omens is literally perfect - perfect as it is possible for something to be. \nAll the love goes to Terry Pratchett, who died in 2015. And also to Neil Gaiman, David Tennant, and Michael Sheen. I cannot imagine other actors playing Crowley and Aziraphale - David and Michael were the obvious choice, and I'm sure glad they did this!\n******************************************************************\nI do not own the TV show, the characters from the book belong to Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. Amazon Prime.\nSong - Golden Days by Panic! At The Disco."}
