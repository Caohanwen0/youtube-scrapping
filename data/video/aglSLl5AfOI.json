She is just the highlight of the whole show. Her character is SOO-O great and she is playing perfectly! Her unique gift of preeminent femininity is absolutely mesmerizing. Her exquisite beauty and charm are totally unmatched. Thank Goodness she's been present in each episode of the Season 4 so far. Hopefully the share of her presence in the frame will increase going forward. It's such a delight - watching her play!", "I love Root and Shaw, I admire Amy Acker and Sarah Shahi and I really like your vid !! <3", "I absolutely love Root ! I'd love to see even more of her in the show, she's still kinda under used.", "2019\nThis is the show I fell in love with Amy Acker.  Now I've found her on Angel, she can do any kind of acting.", "Love this. Yours is one of the only videos on this site that I feel shows accurately Root's growth as a character. Well done. :)"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc346thcxcLzo1A80xGmIWg", "description": "I love Root, I love her character development on the show, so I decided to make the tribute video.\n\nNo copyright infringments intended.
