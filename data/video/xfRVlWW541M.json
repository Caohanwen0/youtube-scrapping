Hope there are more of this quality coming up.", "Finally an episode with some gritty horror for adults!!! Episode 5 rocks the demon budgie!", "I liked episode 4. Lol. Also, I can\u2019t wait for Ronen Rubenstein tonight!!!", "I have a theory for season 10. \nWhat if the Siren and Aliens are just imagery representing pilgrims (sea) and immigrants (sand/land) migrating to America. (By the sea, travel on boat. By the sand, traveling by land.)", "Loved the stream. I do disagree about to much murder house. Really we haven't seen murder house in over a decade minus 3 minutes in season 5 and that crap of season 8 that was pointless. I think there are at-least 41 murdered people in murder house. Minus Micheal's killers cause all that got redone. The un-borns of all the women and a few more I discounted. Obviously there are more. If you can't tell I loved M.H! Always fun to come back to."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nJoin the Freaks of AHS on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheFr..."}
