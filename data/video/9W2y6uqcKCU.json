Loved every episode.", "That scene were Reese is fighting Andre the Giant, and that one government agent, are a big reason of why he's such a great character:\nHe kicks loads of ass, but he's never garunteed to win every time things get violent. Some times he really has to struggle to come out on top.\n\nAlso, you should be commended on that Lost music montage.", "\"Does it look like I play video games Leon?\"\nBest line ever.", "The clips with Harod and Grace reminded me that in real life, they are husband and wife. They said that it was an extra acting challenge, since they both got out of the same bed in the morning, went to the filming, and had to act like two young lovers who were falling in love for the first time.. I'm sure  it was easlier for Carrie, Micahel Emerson's wife than it was for Michael... haha"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkOQfPHKjU0lQnVpVuqfeew", "description": "**This video may contain spoilers if you haven't seen some episodes**\n\nTwitter = MikeJCawley\n\nPart 2: "}
