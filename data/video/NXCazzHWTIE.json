So maybe Michael is going to be a butler like Spalding was for the witches and then discovers he\u2019s the antichrist??", "Mary, the full trailer comes out tomorrow, this is a teaser of the trailer", "The way he\u2019s been promoting recent seasons literally have us waiting till the last min kinda allows me to overshoot my expectations. Roanoke and cult weren\u2019t so bad bc they were their own themed season. But w this season because he did say it was a crossover I\u2019m expecting all the bells and whistles and bring back old ahs vibes like in seasons 1-3. I watched this trailer and it just makes me feel like it won\u2019t be what I\u2019ve been thinking it will be like for months now and I\u2019m back at square one and don\u2019t really know what to expect.", "Your my fav AHS YouTuber Mary. I love your reactions."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nImages by Danny Vera.
