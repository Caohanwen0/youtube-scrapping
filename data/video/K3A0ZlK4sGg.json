The exchange of words between two strong-minded women is just so intense. Great respect for both women.", "What Fiona never truly realized is that Laveau lived there by choice, rather than circumstance.\n\nShe was powerful and influential enough to have the whole country if she wanted, but she chose to reside in the 9th Ward where she could actively protect her people.", "this season was about racism, mothers and daughters, women owning up to their power, and lots and lots of death and blood, but i gotta say - it's kind of sweet that an Immortal Voodoo Queen didn't up and leave for some isolated tropical island somewhere and instead chose to stay as a member of her community in a place where women in her community would regularly congregate. that's really nice that she cared enough for her people to remain close to them and look after them."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKkXdiYIlf8IVfAS0Umf2ug", "description": "Property of FX."}
