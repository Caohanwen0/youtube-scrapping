To Finch, Reece, Carter, Fusco, Shaw ... yeah, you, too, Root ... thank you for superlative entertainment.", "I just started watching this show on Netflix, and I love it!  \n\nBut if anybody is watching me, they are fucking bored. \ud83d\ude02", "Awww, season 1. The good old days of POI. I hated when they killed Carter off, it was never the same and I couldn't watch anymore but those first 3 and a half seasons were truly golden television. Back when CBS actually had original programming and not just rebooting classic shows lol.", "Great show, but I wish it had been on HBO rather than CBS..."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNFORB3o9Bg3d6FiAfdUL1A", "description": ""}
