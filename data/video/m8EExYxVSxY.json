She MADE AHS what it is now. Her characters were so rich and powerful. Also, she's a beautiful woman.", "Jessica Lange's natural beauty & intelligence continues to blow me away.", "Jessica Lange is perfect.", "I cannot BELIEVE this interviewer called the disabled actors \"freaks\" when he's talking about them outside of the show, in the show they play the role of the freak and that's what they were known as in that era but in the real world disabled people are not freaks and in this day and age should not be branded that way. don't know if anyone else picked up on that it just pissed me off", "Brilliantly talented! Her body language shifts slightly at 2:20 minutes into the interview when he says 'freaks', she's also thrown off and looses what she intended to say. This says a lot of about what type of person she is with regard to her tolerance. Massive AhS fan! Cannot wait for season 5!
