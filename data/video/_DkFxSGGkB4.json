Best bit is when the Machine ends the series with the line \"and maybe... this isn't the end at all.\"", "I get the chills whenever Finch says \"I built it\". Great show!!", "Actually, Finch never had the intention to put this backdoor. Let's just say that later events \"convinced\" him to use the backdoor. Great show! Recommend to watch!", "I miss that show so much. It was the best show on television. I wonder sometimes, especially the way things are today, if the idea of the machine is becoming closer to the truth every day.", "Is it weird that my third favorite character in that series after Reese and Finch is the Machine? I think the Machine is AWESOME!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Go0m6noApSuo9GDlEy0_w", "description": "Harold Finch explains The Machine"}
