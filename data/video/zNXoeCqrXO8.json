The way Root looks at her and then Shaw begins to look at her like that towards end of season 3 I love it", "AMAZING! As someone said below this song actually sounds like its coming from Shaw's perspective.", "IDK how many times I watched this video. It's funny that a song from Demi Lovato would be fitting for characters like Shaw and Root but it is and you make a great fanvid out of it. Great job!", "OMG this mix is great. The fact you have the breakfast song make you a great individual lol. I actually lived near where this took place (the station) while in college.  We all watched this show every morning lol."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Xp4sPbiPksiKjz4maYUyw", "description": "fan video\nPerson Of Interest\nDemi Lovato - Heart Attack"}
