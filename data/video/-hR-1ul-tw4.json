I would Love to have Frances Conroy, Dennis O'Hare, & Lily Rabe back \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude4f", "So long as Ryan is involved in some capacity, I'd be okay with someone else taking the reigns for AHS. I wouldn't mind if it moved to Netflix, wouldn't really make a difference to me... although I'd still want it weekly, otherwise I'd binge it in one day and have to wait another year.", "Hey there I missed this today Mary !! I\u2019ll be in Florida next Wednesday so I will come to you from the beach. Love to you all Patty", "If you haven't watched any of The Handmaiden's Tale on Hulu (or by other means, I dont judge! lol) Its second season just started and it dark AF! Or The Oazarks is fucking AMAZING. I'm not a Jason Bateman fan, but he's great in this \nIf Ryan passes the torch to someone new i'd have faith in them. Ryan is AMAZING at casting and hiring people, so I know he'd make sure his Cardinal waiting in the wings is going to be up to snuff to take over the Papacy!", "Watch Charmed on Netflix. It's kind of like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but it's about three witch sisters who battle demons with their special powers. There is 8 seasons. If you love Ash vs Evil Dead, you'll like Charmed. It's not as violent as Ash vs Evil Dead, but it's still an entertaining show. Most likely you heard of it."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nWelcome to American Horror Story Weekly Wednesday Live Stream!
