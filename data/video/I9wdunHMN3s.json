Its like her will and fight to remain alive and keep her powers were sooo strong. One thing everybody has to admit, she was a STRONG AF WITCH. Nobody could stand in her way", "I think if Fiona didn't ask her to bring Luke's mom back,Nan and Luke could've live a happily ever after.", "Jessica Lange says so much through her character without having to speak a word.  You can tell Fiona is apprehensive about a new possible Supreme able to show her up, it's almost like Fiona was begging for Misty not to be able to pull it off @1:40.  And then comes the eyeroll, \"Great, another witch bitch I have to compete with.\" Really brilliant subtle details in Lange's Emmy worthy performance.", "Fiona eye roll is everything and more!", "I love how Fionna uses her power so effortlessly!!!
