I believe the title will be AHS: Township. Hear me out. If you look up the definition of township, it means a county divided by corporate power/suburb. Also, last year after the season 6 finale, AHSFX posted on their Insta and Twitter a video of waves that said \"sweet dreams\". townSHIP. Isn't that something R. Murphy would do? I'm 80% sure on the title.", "My Theory:\n\n\nThe show starts with an eerie TV filter on the election video. After Trump wins, the whole streets are crowded with Protests. Pedro, a Hispanic protester protests outside. Sarah Paulson's character is happy that Trump wins. She try's to show it at the crowds. Pedro gets mad and maybe tries to hurt her. She then kills him. According to the leaks, protesters will get in front of her car with The \"Justice For Pedro\" signs after she is acquitted of the murder. I hope my theory is right, or half right. :)", "Gurl I love all the theories, keep em coming!
