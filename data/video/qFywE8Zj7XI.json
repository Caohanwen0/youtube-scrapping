I'm looking forward to seeing how the final series plays out - though Iwill miss it when it ends. There's been talk about it possibly being rebooted through Netflix or Amazon - I wonder if the main cast and writers would be up for that if it was picked up? Or would it have to be a totally fresh start with different characters taking up the fight?", "Michael Emerson Rocks!", "I can tell he's really bugg'd out in real life like the characters he plays. He plays them too well", "He kinda talks like Terrence McKenna", "WHAT A TERRIBLE sound recording :o I hope its not with the interview technics!!!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbFvKliV5_ZksbnNm9AShFA", "description": "Michael Emerson takes questions and discusses Person of Interest, Lost and current plans.
