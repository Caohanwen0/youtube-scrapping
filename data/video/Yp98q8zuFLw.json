I got a little choked up there.", "The wrestling play by play has me IN TEARS. This has to be one of THE BEST commentaries of this episode.  And that peanut butter and jelly on the same bread is haunting. I shiver at the thought.", "This was really funny how you did the boxing thing with Jingles and The Night Stalker", "I loved this episode this season is fantastic and is my second favourite season but with 6 more episodes left it could reach no.1, loved the boxing commentary lol I hope when Donna's backstory is revealed next week that we get to see some of her interviews with different convicted killers possibly one from AHS past?"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "AHS 1984 Episode 4 Review & Synopsis\n\n\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r..."}
