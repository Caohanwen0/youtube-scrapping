They lost both their son and their daughter. They\u2019re the real victims in this.", "I\u2019m so glad we didn\u2019t have to wait until January to get the video you wanted to post Mary! Also I would like to say I loved this season but only the last three episodes. It felt very slow but got good towards the end of the season. Also I loved the ending with Brook and Donna being the final girls in the end! Both living happy and successful lives. This is the first season of AHS to have an ending that is satisfying.", "I love that there were hints to other seasons"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "#AHS1984 Episode 9 Review & Synopsis\n\n\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r..."}
