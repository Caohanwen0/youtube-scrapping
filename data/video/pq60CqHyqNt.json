I'm just going to watch!\" still one of my favourite scenes from the show. Elias was an awesome character", "Elias and Finch we're badasses in their own way and I loved it ! \nThey couldn't have picked better actors to portray the characters.. \nElias's character needed that friendly yet devilish vibe and he did that perfectly! \nFinch, the intelligent and kind one, but absolutely terrifying when he's really pissed.", "I think Elias was my favourite character, actually. And although it's easy to look back at the series and know what they should have done, I would have let Elias live right from the start. Even though he was a murderous crime-boss, he would have kept peace on the streets and been a useful ally.", "Harold Finch:\nMr Reese, I'm highly uncomfortable being here!\n\nJohn Reese:", "Elias was epic, and i'm glad his theme is too."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGU3fjBOY4CYJPgP7W-bguA", "description": "As requested: a compilation of Elias' theme from Person Of Interest. Like Elias' storyline, it starts menacing, then turns kinder, only to reveal its hidden power and... end on a whimper. Just kidding. Composed by Ramin Djawadi. Tracks used:"}
