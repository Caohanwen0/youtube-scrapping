I kept hoping for a more satisfactory answer to this (remnant of brainwashing from Civil War was my theory) but it never came. They went to him because of his specialist knowledge of Hydra's super solider program but that didn't even come into play. It was just too easily done and glossed over. 2) Why did Sharon give up the Super Soldier serum? By bringing the team to the scientist she endangered him (Zemo & they were being hunted by bounty hunters) and apparently his work wasn't backed up anywhere. She confirmed at the end it was gone for good, very odd decision for the Power Broker to make. 3) Why did Zemo give himself up? He escaped just to give himself up. Everything with Zemo was weird and I kept waiting for a twist that just never came.", "I found it really stupid that after karli shot the big boss, she didn't tell sam that was why she shot her and instead just a stupid drawn out fight", "I think super soldier serum goes away only to have people born enhanced show up (mutants)."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "In this video we'll be looking at some of the biggest unanswered questions and theories involving the ending to Marvel/Disney's THE FALCON AND THE WINTER SOLDIER.\n\nTimestamps:"}
