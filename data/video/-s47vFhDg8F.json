POI has become a \"cult\" show even though did not have a very long TV network run. POI had an excellent creative,and writing staff but that is not the answer.POI had an outstanding group of lead,and supporting actor's.When Sarah Shahi first came on POI no one could predict how well Shaw would meld with the other character's. The success of Shaw came from the fine work of Sarah.The cast made POI,and the fans responded to the cast's work.The \"cult\" will go on ! Oh ! by the way MG you made another fine video ! Your scene's move smoothly ,and flow seamlessly .", "There's nothing wrong with Sameen :D She is perfect!", "this is so beautifully made and fitting for such a brilliant character", "I agree with you R but I'll go further,  Sarah BRILLIANTLY PORTRAYED Shaw so good that I  thought The character Shaw was GROUND BREAKING!!", "I totally agree with you Ron. Sarah Shahi BRILLIANTLY portrayed Shaw!! My favorite character !!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs5W1fbf-7gEEufJwpJ0rQw", "description": "It's been a long time. I wanted to do a video like this for so long, finally I found the right music (and the time), so this is the final result. \nThis character means so much to me and I hope that my work will be able to bring at least a little bit of how she is. Every scene is so amazing and  unfortunately I couldn't put all of them  ;)\n\nThanks for watching!!\n\n\nFandom: Person of Interest\nMusic: John Dreamer - Rise\n\nNO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED.
