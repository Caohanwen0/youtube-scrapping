Following malfunctions in the facial recognition system, Reese and Finch steal 64 next-generation graphics-processing GPU blade servers which, once connected to the networked PlayStation 3s, Finch and Root use to reboot the Machine at full power. When the Machine shows signs that it's failing to place threats in context, Root and Finch have it run a contextual background on them, leading to it identifying them as threats, and locking them out of the system. The Machine has lost the ability to differentiate between past and present, so is forced to relive the 42 times Finch killed it and unable to determine that Root and Reese have changed. With Reese waylaid by an assassin the Machine has sent after him, Root puts herself under an anaesthetic so the Machine cannot use her cochlear implant against her, and Finch has to convince the Machine that he and the rest of the team are not a threat. Upon the Machine's first reboot, it provided 30 different numbers, most of whom were not involved in violent crimes; however, one of those numbers, Jeff Blackwell (Josh Close), an ex-con with a violent past, was dismissed as someone who was not involved in any nefarious activity, only to be recruited by Samaritan.\n\nMay 9, 2016"}
