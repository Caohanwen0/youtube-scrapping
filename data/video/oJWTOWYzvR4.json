He\u2019s always been underrated.", "Lily Rabe is the most underrated AHS cast member. Mary Eunice without a doubt goes down as one of the best performances of the entire series and all of her other roles were superb!! Sister Mary Eunice and Misty Day are two of my top 5 favorite characters of the show.", "Twisty's story made me cry. He is a victim too. I'm not trying to justify his actions, I just feel sorry for him. It's sad to see someone who was originally good become evil all because others  were cruel to him.", "i hate how i still love tate", "Evan Peter, Kathy Bates, Sarah Paulson, and Jessica Lange makes AHS all more worth watching (during daylight hours)"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg", "description": "Top 10 American Horror Story Villains\nSubscribe: http://goo.gl/Q2kKrD and also Ring the Bell to get notified // Have a Top 10 idea?
