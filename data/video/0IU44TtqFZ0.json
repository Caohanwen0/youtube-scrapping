She's just a ball of cuteness... How she played a character as dark and scary as Root is beyond me... but I love her even more for just that", "The hits just keep on coming!!   This is a great time to be an Amy Acker fan because every day there are new treasures to view.  Finally,  A Nutcracker Christmas is on tomorrow night , it seems like I have been waiting forever to see this.  I know I am going to love this film big time.   This was so cute to  see  you as a ballerina  as a little girl.  From Fred to Root and everything in between  you bring a smile to my face!!   Amy, you light up the screen in every series, movie, or interview you are in!!", "saw this movie the other day and it was AWESOME! Actually got nervous on the pivotal ballet scene where Amy's character leaps into the arms of Sasha's character! AMY IS AWESOME!", "She has got to be one of the sweetest people with a beautiful family. Then there's Root. To know how sweet Amy is in her real life, then see her play Root shows her range.  Root must've been a blast to play!  I came to love the character...eventually. Then I loved her!", "Never heard before this story about the spider :o So glad that everything turned out okay !\nShe's one of my favourite actresses, and she was great in the Nutcraker ! :D"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ1zyiCmd3QBRTDw5AoDpgw", "description": ""}
