Most of that guilt (Bael) was all the horrific things that the secret society was releasing to Bael since its creation. Instead of adding to the guilt and making Ares Stronger by forgetting it. She decided to take on the guilt, unleash it to its members (so they could remember what they had done) and ultimately destroy the foundation that it was built on. The old world has no place in the new Times anymore, so therefore it must be destroyed. The old woman may symbolize the old world and the chains are a representation of her guilt because of the enslavement, murder and greed the organization was founded on. Rosa is the representation for the New world (CHANGE). The society thought that Rosa would rise threw the ranks to become president so they could manipulate and control a new generation. Jacob said that Rosa needed to release Bael, NOT CONTINUE TO ADD TO THE GUILT, Murder and LIES BUT SET IT FREE... This is all just my interpretation. Hopefully season 2 will reveal much more.", "Glad someone was able to explain what the hell was happening at the end, I was so confused.
