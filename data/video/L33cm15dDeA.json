Honestly that twist is the Scarier than any supernatural elements, the fact that someone could do that to their spouse. This was truly billie\u2019s best performance yet! I know she is gonna play the hell out of Lark Double Feature", "FINALLY! An adult episode.  And excellent episode.  Little shallow it was all a plot, and everyone was in on it...but The best episode yet!", "I would really like more dark, serious episodes like this. Pleasant surprise after the cheese of the last one.", "This episode was brilliant! A twist I did not see coming but expected. Billie\u2019s character had an excellent build up. And when she goes to the prison in that bad ass outfit!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 9/10 stars loved every second", "This episode was basically an AHS Cult summary, with a hint of coven crossover. Loved it"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nJoin the Freaks of AHS on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheFr..."}
