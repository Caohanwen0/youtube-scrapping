I'm not sure why, but it just *fits*, in a way that perfect CGI wouldn't. Crowley and Aziraphale were never this polished, perfect thing. Both flawed, both odd, never quite fitting in with their respective 'sides'. The CGI really fits that vibe they had going. Flawed, odd, and not quite fitting right.
