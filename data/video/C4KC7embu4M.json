I never expected to see Boba Fett in this episode.  I honestly thought we wouldn't see him until episode 3 or 4", "The set up first showing the Mandalorian\u2019s ability to survive being eaten by a giant creature was an excellent set up for Boba Fett. It planted a seed in our minds first so we don\u2019t question Boba\u2019s return. The twist is improved by the fake out of giving Marshall Fett\u2019s armor!", "I knew boba fett will be in this season but had no idea it would be in the first episode. Amazing episode! I hope boba wears his armour again!!", "You can\u2019t skip over the fact that Olyphant is playing the Marshall after his insanely great show Justified, where he played US Marshall Raylan Givens. This episode was fan service for Justified fans.\n\nHe even had Raylans Swagger and dialog style."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "In this video I take a look at Disney + \"The Mandalorian\" Season 2 Episode1 Chapter 9 and breakdown, review, theorize, and point out easter eggs and details you may have missed! \n\nWATCH THESE;\nThe Mandalorian Playlist: "}
