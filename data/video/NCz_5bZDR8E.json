I can't believe that Aziraphale was turned human and had his memories wiped. The painted wings broke my heart and I would love to write something for this! I doubt I'd get around to it soon because I'm going to be really busy for quite a while but this deserves a story. With your permission I'd like to ask someone I know if they would like to write a story to this. Again loved this, it was absolutely beautiful! Thank you!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9BPoyHpScdew_IFxE6fouw", "description": "Some ineffable husbands \ud83d\udc4c\nThis is an AU where Aziraphale was turned human and had all his memories \u2018erased\u2019... \ud83d\udc40\n\nPlease follow me on insta for more \ud83d\ude14 @sketchoodles"}
