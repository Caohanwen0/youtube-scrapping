Not because he's going through with this expecting to die, but because this means cutting off his connection with John. Not to mention, we than get John yelling louder than we've heard  and even more panicky then we'd expect trying to stop him", "I love how, looking back, we see John in the bank safe figuring out the phone call and switching the briefcases as Finch is on the phone", "Of course Harold tried to save John one final time. Of course he locked him in there. And of course John and The Machine conspired to pay him back and save HIM instead. This finale is just perfect.", "When finch said \"Goodbye John\" I got Sherlock flashbacks of the roof scene and I burst into tears. Not again. I couldn't deal with another rooftop scene.", "Midas Touch - hell, this was one of the funniest Reese's one-liners ever"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCauPw3dshgz4QknvsD1Vbqg", "description": "- Extract from season 5 episode 13\n\n\u2665 Here is the new Facebook page to follow all the latest news of the channel : "}
