How embarassing! To the Sarlacc Pit I go!", "The yellow marking on the helmet is just the reflection of the setting", "It's such a minor detail but I LOVE that IG-11 is pointing his weapon in weird, unnatural ways because his arms can move the way a human's can't. A lot of sci-fi robots have that restriction and admittedly that's because of how many of them are people in suits. With IG-11's design they can go all-out and I hope he does some other crazy gun shenanigans like firing while spinning his torso 360 degrees.", "He spiderman'd that dude right in half.
