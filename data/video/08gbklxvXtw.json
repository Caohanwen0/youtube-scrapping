And THEY NEVER explain how Alexis got her scar (or maybe they did and I don't remember). I really thought this movie was going to be good but it just turned out kinda bad", "I thought this was a really great video and you should definitely do more takedowns I like how you just basically obliterated the entire show!", "This movie had like no plot it felt stupidly aimless??
