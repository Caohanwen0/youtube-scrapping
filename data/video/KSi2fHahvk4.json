He\u2019s the main man ffs lol. \nSounds like Tobin thinks his character could should have been used more and more effectively.\nA tv spin off tv series to answer the questions would be BANG ON. Then the films can evolve and not have us hardcore fans wanting more questions answered", "They definitely should have made his character a relative of Tapp. Even if its just mentioned once during the film, its a nice reference for the fans. One of the things I hated about Jigsaw was that it literally ignored everyone from Saw I - VII apart from John and Jill.", "8:03 I've been lucky enough to meet him, and Shawnee Smith (I volunteer at a convention) last year. He's very polite and as soft spoken as he is in the films. Shawnee even showed up at her booth a full day earlier for autographs before she was scheduled to, I was stationed right across from it and was one of the first to get a signature. Shes also really nice.", "But when is SAW 9 or JIGSAW II ?\nStill so many questions and answers needed. \nYes us real fans don\u2019t care about the blood and gore, we like characters and the story behind the link ups etc."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4GPRqEoZ4zpnTHIxcG5JyQ", "description": "Spiral: From the Book of SAW News Update | Reel Talk Podcast\n\nWhat will the film be about?
