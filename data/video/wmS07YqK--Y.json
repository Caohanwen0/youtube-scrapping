They think they've taken him somewhere Aziraphale couldn't possibly find him.... could he?\nLuckily for both of them, Crowley had already let slip where to find the back route to hell...\n\nAziraphale: PeggyCosplays\nAnthony J Crowley: Halusional\nMichael: Billiegoatscosplay\nBeelzebub: Billiegoatscosplay\n\nMusic is 'Wait For Me' from the musical Hades Town.\n\nGood Omens is written by Sir Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, and this is our adaption of their spectacular creations.\n\nFind our group, HedleyKowCosplay, and our individual profiles on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr for more content like this as well as behind the scenes pictures and footage!"}
