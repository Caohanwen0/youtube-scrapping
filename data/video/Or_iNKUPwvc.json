I didn't get a notification. I just watched it now, though. I was on Facebook, when the theme broke, and my first thought upon seeing it, was Tate's Rubber Man raping Vivien and getting her pregnant. A child born of a ghost and a living person supposedly would be the anti-christ. And, the anti-christ is supposed to bring on the apocalypse. And, while we saw Tate's son Michael and he didn't have claws, that image may be just to suggest the beast that's been inside of him since he was conceived, ready to break out. After all, at 4 years old, he was already a murderer.", "This was so much fun to watch with you", "Congrats Mary, your almost at 6K! \ud83d\ude0a", "Addie is 39 when she\u2019s hit by the car in the first season (Nan is 20 in case y\u2019all were wondering, yes they could be mother and daughter!)", "I didn\u2019t check Twitter when I woke up I came right here to find out the news with you, lol!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\n#AmericanHorrorStoryApocalypse"}
