And I'm still kinda dissapointed double feature isonly gonna have 10 episodes...", "I think the American horror Stories may revisit each season like Murder House, Asylum, Coven ect..", "It makes so much more sense for Murder House to be in American Horror Stories !!", "2 distinct stories and seasons are 2 different things. You can\u2019t call a 5 episode story a season\u2026. Ryan Murphy said double the seasons double the viewing pleasure. 10 episodes is not double the viewing pleasure. That\u2019s the second to least amount of episodes ever in AHS. We are literally being scammed if this season is only 10 episodes"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4GPRqEoZ4zpnTHIxcG5JyQ", "description": "Premiere Date for American Horror Story Season 10 Double Feature & American Horror Stories (+ News)\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ReelToRealPro"}
