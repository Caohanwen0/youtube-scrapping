In the off seasons the population is below 3,000 but during peak vacation season it\u2019s over 60,000. The area is known for having a lot of artists, performers, and is a very popular destination for the LGBT+ community. Also there is a urban legend in Provincetown that actually made the news. There was a man like creature that they called the BLACK FLASH. It looked like a tall and gaunt pale man dressed in all black with a long black trench coat or cape who moved soo quickly that it was described to be supernatural. It was ignored by residents and the police because only kids were the ones reporting this humanlike creature but eventually a rather normal and fairly respected local woman had an encounter with the Black Flash which caused the police to actually take the reports seriously which happened for quite awhile but all of a sudden they just stopped and haven\u2019t happened since. ", "The Pilot was so good", "the first two episodes were equal to that of coven they were amazing\ncant wait for ep 2 reaction", "This season is amazing", "The intro had me feeling queasy with all of the meat and ripping and tearing. Don\u2019t know if this season was written by a bunch of vegans but I don\u2019t appreciate it.
