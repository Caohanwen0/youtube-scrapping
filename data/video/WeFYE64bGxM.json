My absolute, all time, favorite tv show, it is so intelligent and beautiful. I like POI more than Westworld and I wished that it could've gotten the same amount of attention as Westworld has.", "It's fascinating to consider this scene from Peck's point of view.  A strange man, who's he never seen before, sits down, tells him the secrets of the world, and tells him to stop looking.  And it's only at the end, as the man is leaving, that he learns this man is the architect behind the new world.  And then he vanishes.", "\"But believe me, Mr. Peck, this is a mystery you do not want to solve. Knowing the answer has cost me something I value more than my own life.\"\nThat line was delivered so well.
