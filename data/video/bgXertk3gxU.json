As much as i love her becoming the new supreme, i hated how it made Cordelia's reign so short", "I honestly think Mallory is the reincarnation of Hecate!

I think she isnt only a supreme but the goddess of witchcraft because Hecate believed that nothing ever truly dies, that everything is energy that gets passed onto the next.", "Finally a truly kind and pure main character who survived.", "She has magic we dont even see the supreme use are you sure shes 'only' a witch?"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHHNuqF-U2LyJdR65t2Ht5Q", "description": "#witch #ahs #coven #spells #magic #ahscoven"}
