However, I have a very strong feeling you won't be able to stay away and for the POI fan's sake, I hope that's true. If you don't do anymore vids, don't be a stranger, jump on Facebook, Twitter and especially the Reddit group and say hello to us. I am so very proud of the Person of Interest subreddit, there is never a shortage of some kind of great conversation going on there, and this is when I pop in once every week or so. The most common are new viewers who are working their way through the show or have finished and want to share their thoughts. Those posts never get old.", "this is wonderful", "Haha - I thought you were done with PoI?
