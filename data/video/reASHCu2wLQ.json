I was wrong.", "I honestly thought this was going to be Chick-flick.

Or she becomes the Personal shopper for a rich handsome single guy who can't take care of him self and Romance ensue. Boy i was Wrong", "No matter what people say, I absolutely love her \u2764\u2764\u2764", "A captivating performance of Kristen Stewart playing Kristen Stewart.", "Wait i am so confused. What is this movie about? A Personal Shopper? A murder mystery? Or some paranormal shit? I would be making that same confused face that Kristen is making."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzcRQ3vRNr6fJ1A9rqFn7QA", "description": "\u79c1\u4eba\u63a1\u8cfc \u9810\u544a\u7247 \u4e2d\u56fd (2017\uff09\u514b\u8389\u7d72\u6c40\u00b7\u53f2\u90fd\u83ef\n\u00a9 2017 - IFC \u7535\u5f71"}
