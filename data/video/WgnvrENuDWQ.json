You have a very kind/approachable demeanor and although I think it's safe to call you a gnostic Christian (forgive me if I'm wrong), you're respectable about it, which is rare for any gnostic person of any belief system. I always find it weird when I give out advice on how to convert atheists, but if I had to give advice, I'd tell someone to model after you. Despite what your live chat looks like, I feel sorta welcomed by you and I get to hear your POVs, which is interesting to me.", "People who manifest the Grace of Christ, like I see here, are what have given me the opening to consider\u2014 and accept!!
