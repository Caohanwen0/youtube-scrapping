She plays to her fandom sooooo well!!", "Sarah \"Give the gays what they want\" Shahi", "It's interesting what Sarah said about the simulation \"It's the most Shaw could ever show\". It reminds me of an interview a couple years back where Sarah said that she honestly believed Root and Shaw never hooked up, because Shaw would have to overcome tremendous obstacles before she allowed herself to go there with Root and be vulnerable. This confirms it, I think. The simulation was showing a Shaw at the apex of her character development, only a that point would she be a little romantic and intimate with Root."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrt8WtZwxBVXDQbNYRcwg1Q", "description": "Original source: https://www.periscope.tv/w/1mrGmeWEggqGy\nShoot Panel with Amy Acker & Sarah Shahi at ClexaCon 2017\nDate: 2017-03-04\nPerson of Interest"}
