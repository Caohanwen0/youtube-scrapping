Of course, had the series continued, the secret would have remained in tact. I'm sure the rest of the audience was thinking the same thing that was going on in my mind... \"What the hell would it hurt to tell Lionel?\" If he was a dirty cop before, he surely had enough evidence  to take them all down. In a way he was the only true Team Machine player because he was motivated by loyalty to fellow members, not the entity of The Machine. Great acting Kevin.
