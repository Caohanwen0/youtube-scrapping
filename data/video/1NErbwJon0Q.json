I need more Tate", "im over here waiting for the murder house and Coven crossover cause can't get enough of Tate Langdon and Violet Harmon", "I think the new season might have to deal with H.P Lovecraft \"Dagon\" which is a fascinating story. A movie was made about it where two couples are sailing on a boat when a storm comes and find a a strange island town which just gets awesomely weird. I highly recommend it", "Can we skip this season and go straight to the coven crossover?", "i seriously hope its like a haunted ship theme! that'd be so cool!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClGiNHyDZPm4jEOo9UyP5Zw", "description": "American Horror Story Season 7 is coming soon."}
