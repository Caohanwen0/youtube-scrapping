But this is what they've done every season.  Many many many short promo clips. A lot of them having nothing to do, mainly, with the theme of the season.  To throw the audience off. More notably during the lead up to Roanoke. The most straight forward promos were for Coven. Damn I loved those.  I might watch them all again.  I assumed this season was supposed to be about Area 51. Now I'm thinking it's overall theme is about conspiracy theories or Mass Hallucination and hysteria.  Or the truth behind stories fed to public. i.e. cover ups.", "I thought aliens and crop circles were involved too? This seems interesting too. Can\u2019t wait!!", "Since season 10 will be filmed in Provincetown, MA, and there are many teasers of pirates and mermaids, they could do a shipwreck theme with flashbacks to pirates onboard the ship."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClGiNHyDZPm4jEOo9UyP5Zw", "description": ""}
