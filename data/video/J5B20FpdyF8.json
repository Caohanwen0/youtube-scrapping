That's what sets SAW apart from Jason and Freddy. Now that my kids are older 14-20 it's fun to introduce them to the SAW collection. SAW is just one of those franchises that every time You watch You end up seeing something new that You missed before! \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4", "As for Amanda Young, she was an important character, I will not say, because she freed herself from the trap and killed her companion. Strong strength of character and survival, and yet this is appreciated in the Saw series. In my opinion, John and I performed this trap best in Saw 1 with Adam and Dr. Gordon it was a well-thought-out, successful collaboration. But then her proprietary traps that did not give the people trapped in them a chance to break free were, so to speak, not tasty. Because why do a trap in which you will die anyway. In Saw 3, her emotions completely took over her control and common sense, so she did not obey the rules told by John who said: \"I want to play with this\".", "MY QUEEEN!!! \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d", "Where is me boi Dr.Gordon!?", "Ah number 1 will be fan favorite samf Jeff everyone\u2019s favorite jigsaw subject he has the honor of killing John Kramer"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4GPRqEoZ4zpnTHIxcG5JyQ", "description": "Top 9 Best SAW Characters #2 | SAW-Tober 2020\n\nJigsawRules:"}
