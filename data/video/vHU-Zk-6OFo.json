Murder house characters will appear in two, three episodes tops, the ones that will show us Michael's past and how he rose to power.

Dark stuff.", "I feel like I'm seeing heavy links with Cult in this & possibly links (although weaker) with Hotel & Asylum. This has the potential to be the most cerebral series yet.
