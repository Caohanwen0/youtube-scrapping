You know.  xD lol", "It can work both ways - proving that someone did something wrong, or proving that they didn't.  But the old rules apply - if you are not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about.  I like the cruiser cams in police cars - it keeps most cops on the up and up.  But I like this show a lot.  It is imaginative and always interesting."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClzCn8DxRSCuMFv_WfzkcrQ", "description": "You are being watched.
