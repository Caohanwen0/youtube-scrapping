If scathitch (Gaga/Roanoke) was the first supreme that got her powers from ancient Druidic gods, how can this be so, if the witches of Salem learned and stole their magic from tituba, and how were other supremes chosen if scathitch never died?

Am hoping for witches in s7, so nice to see you all again\ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude0e", "Sorry I wasn't there :(", "First!!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "VIDEO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ASYLUM/AMERICAN HORROR STORY!!!\n\nBeyond the Horror: Asylum, is an unofficial American Horror Story Live Review Show.
