I would have to say that Murder House is one of my favorite seasons because it was such a simple season and wasn't too complex, over the top, confusing storylines. But I have only seen the season once. Asylum is just okay to be it didn't motivate me to have to watch episode after episode like Murder House did! My favorite seasons are Coven, Murder House, Hotel, Roanoke, Asylum, and Freak Show. Please shout me out! I can't wait to see the new season of AHS! I also have a YouTube show that will be getting updated very soon. Thanks in advance.", "hey guys sorry miss u I was on the process of visting my Aunt from Florida and process of the moving as well.", "Ok God hasnt given you much? REALLY? You have kids and a husband. that alone is a lot and the fact you are successful in life is a big blessing. Im on disability and am ugly. Being ugly has made it very difficult for me to find a girlfriend. Sorry I just had to say this. :)"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "VIDEO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ASYLUM/AMERICAN HORROR STORY!!!\n\nBeyond the Horror: Asylum, is an unofficial American Horror Story Live Review Show.
