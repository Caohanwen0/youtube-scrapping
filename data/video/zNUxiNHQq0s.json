Then Liv actually summoned Ba'al later once her husband's mistress gave her that spell. To me that makes more sense because in order for her husband and Co to convince Liv the totem was real, they needed to insure she got pregnant when she got it.", "i\u2019m laughing so hard at the recreation of the conversation! now i need a full video of recreating offscreen conversations! so good \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Hmmmm interesting.never really thought about it.I kinda thought the totem did work,but they didn't know it was real.You might be on to something though.Maybe the totem did lead her to conjure Ball.", "I wasn\u2019t mad at this episode, I liked the twist!
