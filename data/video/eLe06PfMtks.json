This show doesn't let up. Tears your heart out, but you still hold out hope that our team would win.\n\nGreat reaction vid! ^_^", "You couldn't predict the show would go here when you started this series, right?!?!! Or that you'd fall in love with Root so hard. I love this show so much. And I love your reactions.", "I love John's response to \"Can you hear me?\" before jumping into action. \n\nI actually gagged during John's farewell with Iris. I can't stomach this crap.", "Remember, almost all of Root's combat abilities come from her connection to the machine. The machine giving that boost to someone as innately lethal as Reese is literal GOD mode. The episode's title is the spelling of God's name in the Hebrew (vowels are omitted).", "The \u201cFather I\u2019m sorry\u201d scene always gives me goosebumps.
