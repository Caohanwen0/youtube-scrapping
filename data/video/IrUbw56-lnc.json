Or John could have found a parachute put there by the machine as an escape. Or maybe Shaw came to the rescue in a badass helicopter that the machine helped her find. Perhaps a \"Thornhill industries\" asset fires a zip line from a nearby building. Either way, I didn't see Johns body so I'm not convinced. Maybe Root is alive too. What if she was taken to hospital, swapped out by a corpse look-a-like to trick Fusco, and is now being interrogated? All of this is far fetched, but by Person of Interests standards, is possible.", ":'( Root i miss you so much :'( \ni love you <3 #RootFOREVER YOU ARE THE BEST THE MOST BEAUTIFUL", "Great video. Especially liked the sound track. Miss the program.", "Great video. You are spot on with the missile and Reece theory. There was an interview with Michael Emerson (Harold) and he said that there was a scene at the end of the episode of a mystery person on a motorcycle that rides away. That was never shown.", "They knew for a while that the show was going to be canceled. I don't know why they removed the motorcycle scene."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqzhPcsI-1sA9u673BTRnUg", "description": "So guys/girls. \nI know their are a lot of questions being asked after the Season 5 finale. I'm not at ease at the way it ended and had a lot of questions ...so I decided to make a quick video .\nYes, I know Root's body is missing from her \"grave\" but the machine can do mysterious things. \n\nInstagram : @ShootLivesOn\nTwitter : Irish1Ellen"}
