Just understated and yet so very apt acting. ", "Like it or not, Reese and Finch are the show.", "The vulnerability of these two strong guys as shown in this scene is fabulously and lovingly done.", "I really like this scene. Why? Because it was here that Reese was forcibly reminded that he was not only one who had suffered Machine-related personal loss. He lost Joss certainly but so did Finch who had already lost Nathan and Grace before that.", "I always enjoy the interactions between Harold and John. Their friendship can be uneasy, but in the end the two are friends and show concern for the other."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF3kXXD7_C8T_I4gMrfSuAQ", "description": "Season 3, Episode 13 - Ending Scene\nBeginning scene of the episode: http://youtu.be/fvOPntsajFc\nPERSON OF INTEREST\n(I miss her dearly, too.)"}
