Her dream about the beach and the T.S. Eliot quote in her letter to Micah at the end speak to her longing to save the planet. And with the mosquito at the beginning, the pig (Lucy),  and eventually the Queen Bee that survived, Sam had a reason to believe life on Earth could possibly be adapting. But as she said to Micah when the Queen Bee emerged she didn't know why or how, just that it happened.  She also was testing on herself as we saw with all the needle marks. So in the end she couldn't leave Earth behind and she decided to risk it. To not give up on the planet. Either die... or live and save life on Earth.", "Movie would have got a 10/10 from me if the Cloverfield monster showed up at the end and killed her.", "Thank you for this explanation :D", "Best way to understand the ending is to avoid the beginning.", "I thought the exact same thing about Elon.
