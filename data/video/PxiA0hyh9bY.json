Thank goodness for the replay.", "I do really hope however that Billie Lourd is coming back in season 8. Because she is amazing !.", "Last night's episode was amazing. Oh Mary did you know that on October 2nd Sarah Paulson announced she will also be in Season 8. I'm sure whenever they do the crossover season by the way which is rumored to be next season, you know Ryan will convince Jessica to come back. Wait I thought Kathy Bates was directing an episode this season? Who else is missing Denis O Hare and Lily Rabe this season?? :(", "I agree MaryGirl. Season 7 has really picked up with episode 3, 4 & 5. It's on a roll !!. The only thing i'm a little worried about is that Evan Peters is also gonna play all these other historical cult leaders. I'm okay with Charles Manson i guess but i'm scared that the rest will be a little over doing it.
