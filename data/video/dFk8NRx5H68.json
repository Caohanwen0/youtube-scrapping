Thank you for everything you do!!", "This one was so awesome!", "I am really enjoying this series. I have never been much of a true crime aficionado, but since my trip to Boston, that all changed. During a ghost tour and cemetery tour, our guide related to us the details about the infamous Boston Strangler. Throughout his story, all I kept thinking was, \"This is so fascinating, and Ryan needs to include this in AHS!

Great job!", "Rodney Reed is up for execution, yikes... c\u2019mon Texas give that man a reprieve!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "Who killed Stacey Stites?\n\nSources:\n--"}
