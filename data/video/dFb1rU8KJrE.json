Maybe elements of this including the whole 80s slasher flick vibes; possibly even tying in some aliens and supernatural ghost/campfire stories and stuff.", "A lot happened during this time in ahs universe. Fiona was supreme. \nThe countess helped Liz Taylor evolve. Lana Winters was making a name for herself.  That was two years after Constance murdered Moira and her husband. Also those nurses who murdered those elderly people to spell out murder in Roanoke. Pretty sure we\u2019re going to have lots of ties to 80s slasher films  , pop culture and more connections to murderhouse. Can\u2019t wait for the trailer premiere at Comic-Con"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClGiNHyDZPm4jEOo9UyP5Zw", "description": "AHS SEASON 9"}
