That one didn't stretch as much as Mr. Fantastic's arms. Still a good video though!", "Putting this all on Loki is way too much of a reach. It's more than likely that Loki took advantage of Thor's death to rally the Asgardians to take over and put Midgard (Earth) under his direct rule since Odin would feel partially responsible for Thor's fate after banishing him.", "This theory is waaayy too stretched and convoluted, too many things Loki could not have foreseen to plan it. Despite his claim about being many steps ahead of his opponents (to paraphrase a line in the Loki series), this feels like beyond him.", "But Loki wasn't monitoring Selvig until AFTER the events of Thor. After he was cast into the abyss.", "5:25 \"Loki knew about the plan to assemble the Avengers\". No, he didn't! I don't know if in main timeline he knew, but if he got to know because of Erik, that happens AFTER Thor returns to Asgard and Odin wake up"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgMJGv4cQl8-q71AyFeFmtg", "description": "What If episode 3 realizes Ultron's dream of taking the Avengers apart, \"from the inside.\" Literally, in the Hulk's case. And as the episode reveals, it was Hank Pym's heel turn as Yellowjacket who was behind everything, all along. \n\nBut rewatching the episode made us wonder: was it really Hank's plan? Or did he have someone behind the scenes, who knew about the Avengers initiative and wanted to conquer Midgard?\n\nIf you're new, Subscribe! \u2192 "}
