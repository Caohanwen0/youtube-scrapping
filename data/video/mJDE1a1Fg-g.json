I remember seeing Billy in a comedy show he was brilliant", "Billy Eichner is hilarious and should be perfect in this show! He will bring a comedy element but he can also be creepy at times. I'm wondering if Paulson will be some type of  political person and he works for her as an assistant maybe?", "plot twist this was all planned to start at outrage just for fun \ud83d\ude02", "heyy, I really do love this channel and really appreciate all the work and research you put into the videos. However, I kind of think the editing is very distracting and pulls away from the quality of the vid. Some sentences over lap or are cut off short, making it difficult to hear a lot of the conclusion before you edit into another topic. I'm really sorry if this comes across as rude, because like I said before I do really love your videos :) Just a little bit of constructive criticism x"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "PLEASE NOTE: I DON'T OWN THE CLIP SHOWN IN THE VIDEO.\nOriginal owner: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8V1j..."}
