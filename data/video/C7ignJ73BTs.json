I completely agree with there not being any bad seasons because we have to accept them for how different each of them are yet they're all consistently talked about and entertaining and GOOD tbh", "This was a great video! I agree with this that there\u2019s no worst season, they are all unique", "Love the video Mary! Thank you for busting your butt on your videos to keep us entertained. \u2764\u2764 love ya!", "Cool video. Now make your weekly Wednesday\u2019s longer. Maybe an hour and put your cat in front of the camera cool video", "Awesome video, as usual!  You are a master at critical analysis. It is true that there is no \"worst\" season, but I never thought about it like that until you pointed it out. They are all conceptually sound and well executed; it's just a matter of preference. I can't wait for the new season. I was a teenager in the 80's, so I'm pretty stoked to see what they do with it."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nCover Image by Danny Vera.
