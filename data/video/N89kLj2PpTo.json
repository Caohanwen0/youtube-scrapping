It was not a ghost, lol!! Blake said he did walk by me and waved to give me good luck. I didn't see him so that was a great observation.", "I'm sorry but this season was one of my favorites. It was really well acted and pieced together. The historical correctness thing again...is a stupid complaint. It's a TV show...it's entertainment...not a documentary. Just including those historical cult leaders as characters was fantastic. I love cult culture...I find it fascinating. So maybe I'm biased. But I was glad to have a break from the supernatural elements this season to have a story that reflected the real horrors we are experiencing now. The way they set it up and put all this together was brilliant. Way better than any supernatural gargabe being added to it to dilute it....sorry but why. I love AHS mythology but it didn't have a place this time.", "I absolutely love this season I love all of it! I don't get how people don't like it... each to their own I suppose xx", "Ladies...I love this season.  Why? Because it could be REAL.  So that is why I love it!", "Yeah I was starting to feel underwhelmed too.. Does anyone remember how kick ass the teasers for this season were?! It totally just fell flat"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "VIDEO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR American Horror Story, Season 7, Episode 10!!!\n\nBeyond the Horror: Cult, is an unofficial American Horror Story Live After Show.
