The idea that Razz couldn't finish collecting ingredients for the pie with Mara before she had to sacrifice herself, and then left the finished pie there as an ode to her, what she stood for and the connection they shared broke my heart. Mara's story isn't talked about enough and it's moments in the show with her like that, or the recording with her giving Light Hope flowers that shows how special she was as a character.", "Anyone else a little annoyed that for all the time we put up with Swift Wind (whom I liked, but he's still a lot) we never got anytime with Mara's dragon.", "\"We will make pie tomorrow Razz\"\ud83d\ude2d", "Mara deserves to be remembered as much as all the other characters seeing how she sacrificed her own life to save countless others, of a planet that wasn't hers, renouncing to her own  happyness and her chance to love, ultimatly having to fight her own love only to loose it forever"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC2Bw649-AJJWJDX74f85qg", "description": "i love her and making this video just made me love her more\n\ndedicated to rea, for providing the beautiful endscreen, and telling me \"DO A VIDEO ABOUT MARA,\" and endlessly sharing love and rot for this story\n\nmy twitter: "}
