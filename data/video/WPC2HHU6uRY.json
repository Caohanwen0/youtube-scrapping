To fast and pray to his father.   I think that is why so much emphasis was put on food this past episode.  From the cheating husband being force fed , all he witches feasts,  Coco's  choking, and then being threatened by Meade to be put in a stew.", "Even though it was brief I was so happy to see nan back", "Scathach is an Irish word. She\u2019s a part of Irish mythology. Long story short Scathach was a warrior. Sc\u00e1thach means \u201cThe Shadowy One\u201d.\nSo, being an Irish word it\u2019s pronounced: skaw-huck\nBecause there\u2019s a fada over the a (\u00e1) it\u2019s dragged out: \u201cSk-aww\u201d. Then the h in \u201chuck \u201cis a guttural sound, like clearing phlegm so it\u2019s \u201chuh-ck\u201d.", "It\u2019s not exactly true that we never see the witches worship anything.
