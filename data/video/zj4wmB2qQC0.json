In one of my favorite video games, the main character, a cop, is framed for murder to keep him from solving his father's murder. He's put on death row and on the day of his execution, escapes from prison. That's the game's third level by the way. First half of it is setting up the escape which he later states in the game becomes legendary. Part of the escape has him escape directly from the electric chair during his execution (after the switch is flipped no less) and shove the sadistic guard who was going to execute him in his place. He gets away while the executioner gets executed instead. After escaping, he then goes on a rampaging path of destruction to get revenge and the truth. Part of it leads him to break back INTO the prison in a later level!!!", "\u2665 Here is the new Facebook page to follow all the latest news of the channel : https://www.facebook.com/POI-Best-Of-310975299252501/ ! \u2665", "I don't get how Shaw got the gun and the axe.", "another*\n\nNot \"an other\"."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCauPw3dshgz4QknvsD1Vbqg", "description": "- Extract from season 5 episode 8\n\n\u2665 Here is the new Facebook page to follow all the latest news of the channel : "}
