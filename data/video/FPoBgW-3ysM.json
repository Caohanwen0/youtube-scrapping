Actually, the whole episode was one of the best ever!", "This show is on Game of Thrones/Breaking bad levels now. Classic. And this isn't even the season finale ", "Emerson shows pain and bewilderment so incredibly well. Caviezel does an incredible avenging angel!", "I absolutely loved that the first few minutes of the episode were completely synced with a song... The Endgame are by far my favorite episodes of person of interest (along with a few others) and btw Simmons was a really badass villain!", "What a fantastic episode, this opening blew my mind like this show has never done before I'm sur if someone had told me yesterday \"Tonight's episode will skip the starting sequence, instead we'll see the repercussions of Carter's death with Jonny Cash's Hurt playing\" I wouldn't have believed it."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPiQaJd58GgMs5k970WE38g", "description": ""}
