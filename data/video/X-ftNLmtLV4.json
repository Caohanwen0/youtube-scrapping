It is no secret Shaw has a crush on our favorite dog. Will she be able to spend some alone time with the dog ? Will she always be second on the dog's affection to Reese ?\n\nLet's form a group of shippers, I say let's call our selves ShawBear, sounds nice.\n\nI do not own the rights, just watch this superb show."}
