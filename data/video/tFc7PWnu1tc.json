In the beginning she says to Nyles, \"I'v been to more weddings than you can imagine\". With the hint at the end, it's clear she's in the loop as well. Great video btw:)", "The post credit scene is not a \"plot hole\". Roy was still stuck in the loop, that is an alternative reality that exists only for him. The Nyles and Sarah that escaped the loop are in the \"regular reality\" now,  their other versions in the loop (for the people stuck in the loop) are not the Nyles and Sarah that escaped the loop anymore, they just exist for the people stuck in the loop (if that makes any sense).\n So Roy notices that Nyles was able to escape the loop, since he did not recognize him.", "Nana is definitely part of the loop. It's referenced in the beginning when she talks about how many wedding speeches she's heard.\n\nEDIT: Just read the writer said he imagined him being in the loop for 40+ years.", "I only just realized that Sarah was on the phone with JK\u2019s character before nana goes up to her"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "In this video we take a deep dive, review, recap and explain the ending to Hulu's latest romantic sci-fi comedy PALM SPRINGS starring Andy Samberg, Cristin Milioti, and JK Simmons.
