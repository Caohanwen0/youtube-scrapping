I could totally see it! This is the kind of stuff I wish would come into the show. Like Ryan said all the seasons are connected. So have more characters from other seasons pop up to make more connections! Don\u2019t just say they\u2019re all connected and in the same universe and give us a few characters that connect seasons together. I just feel like it\u2019s a huge miss that Ryan could easily fix that would give so much more depth to the show.", "Well thought out and thoroughly explained. I hope AHS picks up the Jenny Reynolds storyline up in a future season or it\u2019s own AHStories episode!", "This is very interesting! I think they can go deeper into Mead\u2019s story", "Hello, Mary. I just wish the spin off could've center or develop those mysteries, such as what happened to Jenny after all these years; the little girl without eyes in the Murder House (Constance daughter); the Murder House before and after the Apocalypse; Shachath taking Michael's soul to Hell after Mallory killed him and both reunite with the Devil with special appearances of Papa Legba and other underworld deities; and other ideas that would be awesome to know. Greetings from Monterrey, Mexico.", "I love that you have someone that dislikes all your videos, Mary.\nMeans you're doing something right. \n\nThanks Debbie for the awesome theory! Forgot all about little Jenny."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nJoin the Freaks of AHS on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheFr..."}
