I\u2019m coming back to your channel for season 8, but I can never watch your lives because we are 4 hours ahead of you here.", "Sorry to have missed this, no notification again... YouTube really sucks with that lately.\nAdina Porter was in seasons 1, 6, 7 & now 8 will be her fourth season.", "My FAVORITES are Asylum, Coven, Freak Show, Cult.... The others are Okay... Murder House's ending had a great surprise.  Hotel is my least favorite.  The storylines were weak, way too much sex & violence overkill, and Gaga's \"acting\" was cringe worthy sadly for me. Was Queenie's death necessary?? \ud83d\ude11 So SAD!", "kathy bates is coming back", "I'm do anxious i check ur channel all the time for updates i wish people were looking into this season like they were for season 6 but thats because it was a mystery season"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "American Horror Story Season 8 News and  Chat"}
