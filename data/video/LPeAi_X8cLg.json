It's crazy how underrated it is and how the geek fanboys aren't aware of it as much like Arrow, The Flash, Agents of Shield etc. This show is a better superhero show without being an actual superhero show.", "THIS was the moment Person of Interest transcended your basic run of the mill procedural. The revelation of Elias and his game made this universe bigger and more exciting.", "One of the best scenes in the whole show. If you weren't hooked by now, this is the part were the show will definitly get you.\n\nAlso, the final scene were Elias is seen from behind reminds me of Sopranos.
