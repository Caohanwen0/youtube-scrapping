Do a break down of each episode (milk it like a shane dawson documentary)", "I am loving the individual breakdowns. The darker side of Sabrina the Teenage Witch is definitely interesting. Even if I can't watch it, the breakdowns are helping understand it and so far, I am liking this version of Salem. Instead of a warlock cursed for doing something 'stupid', he's a darker spirit of a Salem warlock killed in the trials. Definitely liking this so far.", "Dr Sapirstein is a nod to Rosemary\u2019s baby just FYI. \nWardwell tells the \u201cgirl\u201d she picked up on the road at night that she\u2019ll take her home and call Dr Sapirstein in the morning. \nLoved that!!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "Get ready to cast some spells because it's my new breakdown series for \"The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.\" This is for season one episode 1, \"October Country.\"\n\nFollow me on twitter: www.twitter.com/ThinkStoryYT\n\nHelp me translate this video: "}
