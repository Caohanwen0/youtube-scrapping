I love Ash vs. the Evil Dead. It was the best TV series Ive seen in years. It was a fun ride! Ill be rewatching all the shows for years and years!", "Most people don't have cable and us younger generations don't want cable and  like me have mainly watch Netflix or Amazon or hulu etc.Lets be honest most people in this generations binge watch shows like this not way a whole week.I'm hoping it goes to Netflix or amazon prime as I see more success there.I have singed the petition and hope it get brought back from the dead because it's been great:)", "I love how much you say \"fuck\" \ud83d\ude02", "Very upset about this... It\u2019s just because Starz is a pretty obscure network, and believe it or not this show attracts a lot of the younger generation. If this was a Netflix show, the show being canceled wouldn\u2019t be an issue.", "Netflix has picked up much worse shows that got cancelled. Would be so awesome for them to snatch up Ash from Starz"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "Let's try to save #AshvsEvilDead and sign the petitions.
