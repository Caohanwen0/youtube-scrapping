He had class and intelligence.", "I always liked him and his friendship with scarface. That kinda loyality in mob is rare. Also his admiration for Carter was so pure. So was his admiration for harold. He had class and organization level beyond any villain the team ever encountered.", "Finally, someone who creates a compilation of great scenes and doesn't bury all of the amazing dialog under annoying music.", "the best series in its genre,i still cant believe they canceled it   i hope the ending was a simulation and the SHAW will be back someday"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8K1-uC3NazkioWBnDk_5w", "description": "My montage video for Elias and Scarface.\n\nI hope that this project will be pleased to you ;)\nCan you share it? \n\nThis is the editing of Elias and Scarface.
