Apart from that, she was emotionally unstable meaning she couldn't focus on her magic. And on top of that, Kyle has superhuman strength, so she didn't have much time anyway. Overall this makes for a good ending for Madison.", "I didn't feel sorry one bit when Madison died tbh. She's done so many shitty things, trying to kill Misty, trying to take control of Kyle, and refusing to resurrect Zoe. When she failed divination, instead of accepting she can't be the supreme, she threatens to expose the coven. What happened to her in the first episode was sad, but instead of moving on and changing her ways she chose to stay the selfish, cold-hearted person that she is.", "lol, this must have been so awkward since they are engaged", "Damn. Knowing that Evan and Emma were engaged while Coven was going on...This must have been a really hard scene for both of them to do xD", "The way Kyle enters the room, you would think that he's the Grim Reaper.  Scary.  o_o"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGIQHvkZPzrna7UHtmlgoXw", "description": "american horror story coven - Madison gets murdered by Kyle/ Zoe brought back to life by Cordelia  \n3x13 the seven wonders"}
