It may not have been the most popular season, but by the gods it was very enjoyable!", "I think that each of the past places of the other seasons are going to be the grounds where each outpost is located. Freak Show and obviously Hotel will most likely be Outpost 1 and or Outpost 2. That would mean that Murder House and Coven aren't the only seasons that will have a big connection to Apocalypse. This will probably be the big twist Ryan Murphy has been talking about this season. BTW there's a lot of theories suggesting Murder House will be the grounds where Outpost 3 is located, the main setting of Apocalypse.", "Damn AHS,  your ability to build suspense and anticipation is incredible! Cannot wait for the apocalypse -  (never thought I\u2019d say that)", "Murder House burning\nElsa's Freak show burning\nNow the Cortez Hotel"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClGiNHyDZPm4jEOo9UyP5Zw", "description": "AHS8 premieres wednesday September 12th, 2018."}
