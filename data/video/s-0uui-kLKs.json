Just one would've made me happy.", "Okay but the swell in the Chipped Catra fight scene with Adora...that was when I realized: I LOVE THIS SOUNDTRACK. IT'S SO GOOD. I can list the exact moment in that entire sequence where Catra takes a step back onto Prime's lil raised platform, says \"He will free all of us. Forever\" and then leaps into action and BAM, there's the infectious swell that I love so dang much.", "My favorite motif is what I call the \"She-Ra Motif.\" It's that little \"ooh ooooh\" theme that comes up whenever She-Ra does something amazing. The first couple times it shows up when She-Ra just appears, her very presence is amazing enough. It plays all the time in season 1 as Adora discovers more about her abilities, and is especially awe inspiring there. It's the kind of theme that makes all the characters stop and stare at how incredible She-Ra is. ", "Sunna's score for She-Ra is amazing, the amount of themes woven throughout the entire series really elevate the story being told", "The score is incredible. It plays such an undernoted role in the series, but without it Shera wouldn't have been nearly as good as it is."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC2Bw649-AJJWJDX74f85qg", "description": "sunna release the rest of the tracks please\n\nhttps://twitter.com/5x5takes"}
