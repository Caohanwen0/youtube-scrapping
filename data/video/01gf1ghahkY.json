ITS A LOVE STORY", "it's so weird to see aziraphale's body with Michael sheen's accent", "He is the best comfort character- this angel has all the best taste", "What I truly love about Aziraphale is that he has been on Earth since the beginning, has probably witnessed more horrors, acts of cruelty, and violence than most of us will ever imagine, and yet...it has not broken him. He has not become bitter, cynical, or closed-off from the world. He still appreciates all the good that he sees and finds joy in simple things, be it a nice plate of crepes or a really good antique book. That takes real strength, and that's why Aziraphale is one of my top five favorite fictional characters of all time.", "Michael : \"Aziraphale loves Crowley\"\n\nme :  screams"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLGxYconTzhtibhR9Xd7KWw", "description": ""}
