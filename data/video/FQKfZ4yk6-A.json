Let\u2019s face it, she was amazing on Hotel AND Roanoke.", "I really don't understand why everyone is mad about Lady GaGa coming on the show. After season 5 ends then start making judgements.", "I remember coming back from class in college and my roommate said I needed to see something. (I\u2019m a diehard Gaga fan... and used to be a huge AHS fan..) when I saw this, I literally collapsed to the floor. My little gay heart couldn\u2019t take it.", "This is awesome! I can't wait to see all the freaky stuff that's about to go down at the Hotel. Although I'm disappointed Jessica Lange isn't going to be there (?), I think Lady Gaga would be a wonderful addition. \nIf you noticed, AHS picks songs from artists who are self-proclaimed \"Freaks\"- Lana Del Rey, David Bowie, etc. And now we have the amazing Lady Gaga! Hopefully her acting is as good as her music. ", "That's freaking so cool!!!! I'm so in to it YAASSSSSS"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7ked6a_haOTb0x_YgYf6qw", "description": "Lady Gaga joins American Horror Story Season 5.\n\nAmerican Horror Story Season 5 Teaser #1, American Horror Story Hotel Season 5 Teaser, AHS Hotel, American Horror Story Hotel, American Horror Story Hotel Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga AHS Hotel, Lady Gaga, AHS Lady Gaga, American Horror Story 5x01 promo, American Horror Story Hotel 5x01 Promo, American Horror Story 5x01 Teaser #1, American Horror Story 5x01 Teaser, American Horror Story Hotel 5x01 Trailer, American Horror Story Hotel 5x01 Trailer,"}
