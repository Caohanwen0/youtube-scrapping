The footage, the quotes, the sound editing... Great job! I do agree with waldomarek.

But as I said... this video is awesome.", "Amazing video, you're so smart!\nHR had a very important part in the show..Story, characters, actors..they were all great!", "Absolutely amazing!", "This is an excellent job!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8h64d0wzg6M45Ad_Plst6Q", "description": "ONLY WATCH IF YOU ARE UP TO DATE WITH THE SHOW!\n\nSince the big conclusion to the HR storyline a few weeks back iv been wanting to make a sort of trailer version tribute / recap, and when I heard this cover of Heart Of Gold I thought it would be perfect to combine the two!
