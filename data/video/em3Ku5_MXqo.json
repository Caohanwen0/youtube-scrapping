It's everything I wanted and more. Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett are literary geniuses and I've waited 84 years for the show. Go watch Good Omens on Amazon Prime!\n\nAnd, as always, \u201cAll tapes left in a car for more than about a fortnight metamorphose into Best of Queen albums.\u201d\n\n\nFootage is from Good Omens.\nMusic is Diminuendo by Lawless & Somebody To Love by Queen.\nColouring is mine.\n\n\nWEBSITE: "}
