Saw many action thriller TV show & movies. No matter how many days past. Person of Interest will be remembered. Its Epic. Yes Jim Caviezel did absolute justice to John Reese Character. Its like what RDJ is to Tony Stark, they feel one person with two different names, similarly John Reese feels Jim, no Jim feels John, wait both are same.", "Jim Caviezel could have been an awesome Batman.", "The body language of Jim Caviezel throughout this series was that of Terminator. So, we know who should be the one post-Arnold.", "Jim Caviezel underrated actor and thumbs up who else thinks he could play Batman", "\"Mr. Reese, I'm highly uncomfortable being here.\"\n\"I'm highly uncomfortable having you here. But I need a spotter.\"\n\nI love that exchange!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPTu6NY2a3RR_umbSkHTTeQ", "description": "Collection of John Reese's Gun Fight Scenes, especially big gun.\nBy product of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0HWU..."}
