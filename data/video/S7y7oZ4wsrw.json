I fell in love with Freak Show the 2nd time I binge watched it \u2764\ufe0f.  Pepper's story is heartbreaking.  Edward Moredrake is fascinating.  Sorry Mary, I know you praise Hotel, but it's sadly my least favorite.  I sat through it originally every episode hoping it would get better.  I Loved Queenie in it, but hated that they killed her off. I did love also having Billie Dean Howard back.  Gaga's \"acting\" was so stiff, I couldn't get past that.  The storylines were weak and stale for me and the oversaturated sex/violence was over the top and uncalled-for. Not my cup of tea.  I wanted more Horror element, and I felt Ryan put more sex in it for Gaga perhaps instead.", "October 31, 2018 will be on a Wednesday... an episode on Halloween will be amazing!", "I missed it.  :(     Will catch you next time and I can't wait.  :) You're AWESOME!", "I hope they don't make Billy Eichner like Evan's BF or something stereotypical. I would love to see his serious/darker side again. It was such an awesome side of his acting range that took a lot of us fans of his by sursprise! I liked it, I loved it, I want some more of it! lol\nIf Angelica Huston even just did an episode or two arc I'd be satiated! Freaking love anything she is in!", "DAMN! I missed it... these wednesday morning work shifts suck"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nWelcome to American Horror Story Weekly Wednesday Live Stream!
