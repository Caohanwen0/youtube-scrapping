In fact, I love that it waits until episode 4 to reveal that events aren't happening at the same time, and that it doesn't spell that out for the viewer. The show respects the intelligence of its viewership and I deeply appreciate that.", "I never played the games or read the books so realizing there were more than one timeline going on took a few episodes for me. I still really liked the season even going in cold.", "Who else has had \"Toss a coin to your witcher\" stuck in their head for a week straight?", "actually there are 3 timelines.\n1. yennefers timeline (origin of her)\n2. geralts timeline (when he's in blaviken)\n3. ciris timeline."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "In this video we breakdown and explain the ending to season 1 of Netflix's \"The Witcher\" based off the fantasy novels by Andrzej Sapkowski.
