If you think about it, 1984 had a lot of elements from previous seasons, a haunted location, serial killers, occult practices, etc", "Queen your theories are so original and creative yet they make so much sense, amazing job", "I like some parts of this theory, like we know that Twisty was made into a comic but I think it would make more sense of some seasons were the real world whereas others are a story. Like we know that season 6 is very much based in reality, and seasons 3/8/1 are all linked but season 4 could easily be a series of comics and season 9 could be a novel written by Bobby or even by Brooke or Donna", "what an amazing theory mary, i love how your mind works, thats what keeps me coming back to youre channel for more.", "Another cool theory video! Loved this one, Mary, it\u2019s fantastic."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nJoin the Freaks of AHS on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheFr..."}
