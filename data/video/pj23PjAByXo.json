That scene where Candy reads Blanca's looks, was actually written by Janet Mock. All of her's and Elektra's reads were written by Janet Mock, as the actress who plays her Angelica (Candy) Ross mentioned on BuzzFeed after-show when one of the hosts on the show said \u201cCandy's mouth is lethal\u201d then the actress replies, \u201cthat mouth is really Janet Mocks though\u201d lol. And she continues to say that Janet is living vicariously through Candy. This girl has a master's degree in reading and shade, so you know, that's Janet Mock, actually lol. So if you were wondering who wrote for these girls, it was Janet Mock", "Dominique Jackson is such an amazing actress.", "Thank you for posting theses :)"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nMARY'S BOOKS & THANGS:\n--website: www.maryannmoody.us\n--Patreon: "}
