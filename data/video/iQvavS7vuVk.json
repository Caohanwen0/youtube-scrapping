The mess of this episode is inexcusable otherwise. It is their way of saying that they are aware of the heavy criticism that the show has received (specially for the first two episodes), but they are still the ones controlling the narrative; they will return to whatever location they wish to (pretending to burn down MH just confirms this), regardless if fans are sick of them or not; they will continue hiring nepotism kids, even if they are not talented; they will do whatever they want because they simply can, and we will continue to watch it. \"Game Over\" is the worst thing I have ever seen on television. And will I come back for season 2? Yes, I will.", "American Horror Story has finally turned into Glee, progressively in downward trajectory.", "The most confusing episode so far , at the end I was just done lol .", "Why does Scarlet only visit Ruby in the Murder House on Halloween?
