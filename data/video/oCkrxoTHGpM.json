It's great how they added that twist to bring more reality to the series. I believe it's also tieing other seasons together", "I'll be honest, I liked the whole Zodiac aspect they added. I mean they only told a lil blip in \"Frances's\" life to show how she became crazy. I just thought it was cool, reminded me of the movie The Zodiac with Jake Gyllenhaal lol", "Eh...? I dunno why everyone is upset about the Zodiac killer aspect. I mean in Murder House they revealed how The Black Dalia was killed even though in reality it's still unsolved. I thought seeing historical stuff from other perspectives is pretty interesting. After all...it's just a TV show. It's entertainment...not real. But to each their own.", "With this season so far I'm gonna give it a 7.5 this episode braught it down lol.", "Hay MaryGirl. I actually liked the whole Zodiac Killer twist a lot !!.\n\nI mean, think about it. The real Zodiac Killer's identity was never revealed & found out so Ryan Murphy can pretty much take all the liberty and freedom with it to do what he wants. And i think adding the Zodiac Killer in some aspect is really cool i think."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "VIDEO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR American Horror Story, Season 7, Episode 7!!!\n\nBeyond the Horror: Cult, is an unofficial American Horror Story Live After Show.
