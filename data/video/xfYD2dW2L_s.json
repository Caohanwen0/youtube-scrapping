Although John Reese and Harold Finch have successfully prevented numerous crimes thanks to The Machine\u2019s omniscience, the team was unable to stop the malevolent artificial intelligence known as Samaritan from coming online. Brought to life by Greer, head of the private technology corporation Decima, Samaritan has the full power of the U.S. government behind it and is using those resources to hunt Finch, Reese and the hacker, known as Root. The trio, along with Det. Lionel Fusco, suffered a major loss when Samaritan\u2019s operatives wounded and captured Sameen Shaw, their comrade-in-arms.  Upon gaining full autonomy, Samaritan set its sights on destroying The Machine, which now exists only as a few lines of source code in a briefcase held by the team.  On the run and without access to The Machine\u2019s intel, the team must find a way to continue saving lives as they attempt to reboot The Machine and fight back against impossible odds.       \n\nIf you like this video, please make sure to click the like button and share this with all your friends.\n\nSubscribe Here (it's free!) - "}
