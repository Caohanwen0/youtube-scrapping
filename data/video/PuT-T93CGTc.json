I always miss these streams I'm sorry Mary. Hey Mary I have a question for you... Wouldn't you like to see them do kind of like a Victorian style type of season where the time frame is the 1800's. Not sure what Horror topic but I just find that era fasanating.", "I HAVE A QUESTION!! WHAT WAS THE PLOT TWIST IN EPISODE 7?", "Mary, you'll LOVE Nip/Tuck. There are themes and original AHS ideas in there, especially a very prominent figure from S1, which you'll recognise a few seasons in. I watched it when it was aired originally, but I have definitely seen some expansion on things from that series.
