The only logical assumption, therefore, is that Crowley invented a new kind of confection specifically to congratulate Aziraphale on the opening of his bookshop.", "your bit with the medal is particularly amazing, i actually hit pause to go 'holy shit'. and your Crowley overacting is PERFECT. As was the 'oh he's brilliant but no no i totally loathe him' scene.", "Absolutely fantastic! The pacing makes the dialogue and movements flow so naturally. You captured Aziraphale\u2019s micro expressions so stunningly that they look almost lifelike. Also, I love how you situate Aziraphale in the center of the shot and have him framed by Gabriel and Sandalphon on each side; it creates such an oppressive and claustrophobic atmosphere that clues us into how much he just wants to GET OUT.", "Try and tell me this isn't the most romantic shit you've ever seen\n\n(Great work!)", "Until I read the comments, I thought this was a professional storyboard from the show! This is very well made."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaCweWbK2R5gYb7zdebYwrw", "description": "Personal project. No sound. Storyboarded in Storyboard Pro 6, from the script of this scene (found in the Waterstones Deluxe Edition). Summary: Aziraphale is being promoted back to Heaven by Gabriel and Sandalphon just as he is preparing to open his bookshop. Crowley brings him chocolate and helps him stay on Earth.\n\nThis took me...on and off roughly 3 weeks? I had so much trouble thumbnailing this for whatever reason.\n\nTumblr: "}
