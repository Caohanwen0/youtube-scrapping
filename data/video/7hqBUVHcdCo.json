Taking over a Victorian town house in the heart of Soho, the event will immerse fans in the weird and wonderful world of Good Omens. Adapted from the fan favourite 1990 novel by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, the six-part series is an hilarious story of the world hurtling towards the apocalypse, with only the unlikely duo of an angel and a demon to stop it.\n\nThe experience will be open and free to enter from Friday 31st May until Sunday 2nd June, from 11am each day.\n\n Fans can pre-book the escape room, whilst the remainder of the exhibition is free to enter, with additional escape room slots allocated to walk-ins.\n\nThe exhibition and experience opens on 19 Greek Street, coinciding with all episodes becoming available to stream on Amazon Prime Video on Friday 31st May. Additional tickets to the escape room on Friday 31st May, which lasts 30 minutes, will be released at 7pm on Wednesday 29th May through EventBrite: "}
