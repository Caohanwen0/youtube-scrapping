I also finished watching season 8 and I have to say that in the end I was disappointed with it. In the end it just became Coven 2 and I didn't like that. In my opinion a cross-over doesn't mean rehashing old stuff. I would have rather liked it if Ryan Murphy just kept it small. Like the Murder House stuff in season 8. That was only 2 episodes which is fine and I think it would have been better if they did that with the witches as well and just focus more on the new characters.", "By the way................have you watched The Haunting Of Hill House yet ??. If not you should try it out !. It's awesome !!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "I'm out of YouTube jail so it's time to celebrate!\n\n\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r..."}
