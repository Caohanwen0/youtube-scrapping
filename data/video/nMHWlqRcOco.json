Kimberly Bock was my best friend/soul sista. Born February 2nd, 1980, left this world to jam with the greatest in Heaven on August 14th, 2009. Sorry the picture jumps, I trembled terribly that day.\n\nSince Beautiful Blonde will be released February 2nd, 2018 exclusively to my website, www.maryannmoody.us, for purchase, I decided to move the video to this channel.\n\nLinks:\n--website: www.maryannmoody.us\n--Patreon: "}
