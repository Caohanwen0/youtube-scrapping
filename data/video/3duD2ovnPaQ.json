I wish he had a loving mom and dad.", "I love your video especially actor Zach Villa that played the part of The Night Stalker.  He looks so good and did a fabulous job!  I recognize the song too, \"It's all about us\" by \"TATU\" but this is instrumental.  I don't have this version, I have the full length version downloaded.  Could you make another video about The Night Stalker - Richard Ramirez - AHS 1984 using the song \"It's All About Us\" by \"TATU\"??  The song, the music fit really well with the video that you made of him.  TATU is one of my favorite bands/groups and \"AHS 1984\" is the only season out of the whole \"AHS\" franchise that I have ever watched and I really enjoyed every single moment.  And now that it is over, I miss it, I miss watching it.  But so far the videos that you have made of \"AHS 1984\" are really wonderful, you did a good job!!", "I can see some sense from the new halloween lmao", "I love zack villa AS Richard ramirez not real!!!", "When he said \u201cbabygirl\u201d OMG foldkglskfmfksjfjskfk\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKUSkFKzDm_kDGQ05n_mH9A", "description": "American Horror Story 1984\n+ scenes from other movies/series\n\nMusic : "}
