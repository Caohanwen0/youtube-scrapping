Then Queenie opened up her throat to no avail...spewing Miss Mead's white android \"blood\".\nDidn't Mutt and Jeff tell Michael that HE CANNOT let Miss Mead know she's a robot otherwise it'd cause an existential breakdown...she seems to know she's a robot in the very next episode!", "such a shame this series has so much potential and has been one of my favourite since it went down hill from hotel. this series should have been much more episodes if your gonna spend an entire episode on made mead and meeting mutt and Jeff.", "Omg this was hilarious - nearly pissed myself laughing \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Mary -  hope you got some sleep eventually too!", "What if....Misty & Stevie are looking for Scathatch???
