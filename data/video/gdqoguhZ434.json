The first thing a lot of people said was that Ozzy looks like Evan from season 1 so much. The use of that pic for the banner kind of backs up that idea of Kai being the father. Why else would they have used such an old picture of Evan?", "I'm now starting to think it's Kai and purely for one major reason- the cult has no problem killing someone in a split second as soon as they become inconvenient to them. Kai can manipulate most anyone into doing what he wants so even if Ivy protested, if Kai wanted her dead she'd be dead by now. There has to be a reason specific as to why they're keeping her alive and that connection makes the most sense. It would also be plausible for Ally and Ivy to have selected a sperm donor who on paper is perfectly healthy and highly intelligent with no idea of what he is and what he's capable of. That being said I don't think they'll delve into how Kai identifies his new cult members and keeps tabs on people, I think that'll just be a mystery/Ryan Murphy barely has time to go into detail beyond vague mystery at this point", "You\u2019re so awesome!  Love the opening....."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "Let's continue talking about Ozzy and his parents. \n\nLink to Pt 1: https://youtu.be/zr81NBhXymc"}
