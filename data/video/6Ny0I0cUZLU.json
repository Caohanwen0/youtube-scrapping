They are easely the best \"good guys\" in the whole franchise, you can really root for them and simpathise to them. They have very interesting backstory, complex personalities and surely deserved better (not to be in the game at all, honestly). And everything about Jigsaw movie is just... okay, everything about Jigsaw isn't good at all, to say the least.", "I think no matter how controversial the list is, everyone can agree that John Kramer is number 1", "Loved this, would love to watch you make a saw movie tier list where you'd go into detail about every film in the franchise", "Did agent Strahm come close to making the list? He's my favorite (after John of course)."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4GPRqEoZ4zpnTHIxcG5JyQ", "description": "Top 9 Best SAW Characters #1 | SAW-Tober 2020\n\nJigsawRules:"}
