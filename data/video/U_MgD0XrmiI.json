I think this hints at Constance clearly betraying him in some way.", "i'm beginning to think that Cordelia placed Mallory with Coco due to Coco's power of Divination, to protect Mallory, because Mallory is obviously very powerful and important to the Coven and Coco has the resources to keep Mallory safe and does just that. Also, Cordelia summoning and sending Madison to the Murder House though? and Behold going with her? EPISODE 6 IS GONNA BE OFF THE HOOK.", "I think it makes perfect sense about Coco not being able to sense Brock stabbing her in the head because of their identity spells. Mallory had a glimpse of her powers coaxed out of her by the antichrist... Brock was just a scab... lol plus, like Madison said... coco is the weakest... so, her powers probably required some major inner-self digging", "One of these days want to see Dandy Mott pop up out of nowhere. If anything just for comic relief.", "Omg I thought I lost my mind when I saw Mallory turning that deer into a fawn. It was crazy."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\n\u25ba \u25ba mondaysRmurder channel link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHmt..."}
