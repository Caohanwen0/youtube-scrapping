In the present, after Shaw saves another number, Finch begins expressing concern about Shaw's callous treatment of them. Their next number turns out to be a little Russian immigrant girl named Genrika Zhirova (Danielle Kotch), Gen for short, who is deeply interested in espionage and is living with an older cousin in a run-down apartment. Shaw ends up watching after Gen when men come to attack her, and the two start to bond. Shaw explains that she never feels emotions the way most people do. The team learns that Gen had been bugging the phones in her apartment building and overheard information she should not. Some of the mobsters she recorded manage to abduct Gen. Meanwhile, Carter is continuing her investigation of HR and is following Terney when she runs into Reese, who was unwittingly tracking Terney's phone to find out who was going after Gen. Elsewhere, Carter has been asked to meet her partner Laskey at a bar, where he confronts her about her work with Reese. The episode ends with Root arriving at Shaw's loft and abducting her.\n\nOctober 22, 2013"}
