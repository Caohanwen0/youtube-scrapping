They're all witches damnit. Regardless of what Ryan says.", "The only thing I can think is that yes, these two ARE connected, but are possibly from different branches of the same family tree. Charles Montgomery moved to Los Angeles and built the house for his wife then sent for her.

But also it can skip a generation skipping charles", "The most important key I think everyone is missing is actually given in Roanoke. The witch of the wood who Ryan Confirmed was the first supreme.
