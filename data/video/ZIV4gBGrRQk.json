That was the sound of my heart shattering into tiny dead pieces. Absolute beautiful! Person of interest was a great show and your piano covers are perfection!", "Ahhhhh! Gosh this is so beautiful. You've really done Ramin's original piece justice. Thank you! I still have chills from listening to it.", "I love the show and its music, and your piano covers are awesome, glad your still making them.", "Good thing you are still making POI covers :-)", "There's a post with links to your POI vids and this was the last one, and just, you're really talented thank you for sharing your music with us! This last one pulled at my heart and made me want to rewatch the series so thank you for that"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7eex2xjeeRr9m2ATxQUYPg", "description": "This is the ending track from the series finale 5x13 \"return 0\". I wanted to do another POI cover and figured I hadn't done any from season 5 so I went with this one. I don't know if there's an official track name so I just gave it that name XD\n\nI was deciding for a bit how I wanted to edit the video for visuals. I thought about maybe syncing it with the video, but then I wanted to incorporate the final speech from the Machine as well, which I thought was more important, so I spent some time working the text in the video. and when that was done I figured I'd end it with a bit of the ending clip as well XD\n\nAnyways I hope you all enjoy this one.\n\nPerson of Interest music composed by Ramin Djiwadi"}
