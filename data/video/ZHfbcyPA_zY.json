You mentioned a couple of times that you can scale your damage off of Dexterity with a gem. I know you can do this with INT and FOC gems, but I don't know of a gem you can do this with STR and DEX. It's possible I'm missing something but I've seen the attributes info-graphics and the gems aren't on there either.", "The elemental gems give any weapon the ability to scale off of INT but there are no gems that allow INT weapons to scale off of DEX or STR.", "Easiest solution... use all of them early on \ud83d\ude0e", "4yze4\n\nvyn.fyi"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv41e0KJPq52zhLwwnUTBcg", "description": "Are you wondering how the pick the correct set of weapons in New World?
