The trailer uses actual footage from the new season. We never saw actual footage used in trailers before, and had to wait for the premeire, so all the mini trailers would make sense to us. The ambiguity was part of the fun. What I really enjoyed, were all these creative, symbolic, and often times cryptic main cast trailers. The main cast would be presented, and one would dissect and play around with the clues to figure out key plot points and character motivations. While we have had some of that with this season, as I write this comment, a cast trailer has yet to be released.", "I wish they had just done a cast trailer with a cool song over the top that's what I liked about seasons 1-5.", "Those season 6 clips got everyone so hyped-Ryan Murphy is a smart man", "COVEN HAD THE BEST TRAILER", "It may just be me but i feel like Freak Show wouldve made a better movie than an entire series"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "All American Horror Story trailers to date. \n\nLink to FX: http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/ameri..."}
