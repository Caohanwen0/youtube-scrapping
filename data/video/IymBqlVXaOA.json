Incredibly well edited, the music and titles went so well with it and the crisp, clean quality is gorgeous, I must say!", "Holy shit! This is a far better trailer than the official one! In the real trailer they just tell you what's gonna happen in the first twenty minutes", "Fantastic! I'd just say, try not using the title cards from a different trailer, keep it relevant to the topic of the video you're doing. But good job man!", "super boulot bien jou\u00e9 j'adore", "Wow! nice editing :)"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8K1-uC3NazkioWBnDk_5w", "description": "Montage fan made created by me.\nI love James Bond, and you? \n\nThank you for the sharing ;)"}
