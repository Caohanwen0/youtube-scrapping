Unlike most vigilante type guys, Reese uses guns like a boss, and yet he still values human life by shooting everyone in the leg rather than killing them unless he has too.", "F*cking bad ass series...Jim Caviezel pull that sh*t off perfectly I would love to see him as Batman/Bruce Wayne...he'll knock that sh*t out of the park, pretty confident of that...", "he shot 10 rounds at 7 people, 1 person was unhurt, first round didn't hit anyone. I'm assuming reese never misses. It'd really suck to those 1-3 guys who got knee capped 2-4 times", "One of my all time favorite scenes in this show, this one and the one at the hotel with the U.S. Marshals.", "More like, John Reese goes shopping."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzna6u9-rDJG1_7lnCdGpyg", "description": "Person of interest S01E01 - This Does Not Belong To Me.
