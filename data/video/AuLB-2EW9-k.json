I just checked your channel, you have even more of them from my favorite shows. Keep up the good work! :D", "It's so beautiful! Thank you for this beautiful video.", "Oh my good! Hell, I'm crying! This Video is so good, thank you!", "OH MY GOD YOU'RE WATCHING POI :D\nI love that you're vidding it now (even though I'm sorry to hear it's for bad reasons.) But I love this and I really think you portrayed the show well. There were several moments that made me make dying seal noises and then remember that it's almost 3am and I'm not alone in the apartment, so I should probably pull myself together lmao"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCylEe4YVgoaWElc0LAigvdA", "description": "a lovely person told me that the sound was deleted. if you're interested you can watch it with sound here: https://vimeo.com/244249398 \n\nany words to express my feelings about this show would be diminishing. and so is this video."}
