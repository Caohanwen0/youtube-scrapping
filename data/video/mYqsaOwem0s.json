Hoping to cover a ton of new shows and movies in June. Stay tuned!", "STILL no one is talking about why his wife is in jail though", "I liked the show, I don't know why it's getting so much critcism", "I recently finished the show and I have to say it has soooo much potential, and to anyone considering watching to give it a chance. It\u2019s got a good batch of flaws for sure, and the first few episodes move slowly, but it comes along later in the season and becomes quite a charming show in my opinion. It\u2019s no masterpiece but I think it has a LOT of potential. Look at the office- the first season was pretty boring aside from a few good scenes, I hope they give this show a chance to find it\u2019s wings because I can tell it would be really great if given the opportunity.", "I like it. It's got some heart."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "In this video we take a deep dive and explain the ending to Netflix and Greg Daniel's latest comedy series SPACE FORCE starring Steve Carell.
