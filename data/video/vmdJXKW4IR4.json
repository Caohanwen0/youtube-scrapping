I think this season has some of the best written episodes of the show and I can't wait to watch more of it. I love it more and more as I watch it. The trilogy was amazing and I hope to see Shaw soon, even if I have to wait a couple of seasons more (hopefully the show gets renewed in the meantime). So yep, please watch in HD and enjoy! \n\nShow: Person of Interest\nMusic: \u00d3lafur Arnalds - Til Enda\n\nDisclaimer: NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED"}
