So every time Kang \"glitched\" when Sylvie tried to kill him was the \"threshold\" of a previous loop. So next time Kang lives through the loop his new \"threshold\" will be the point in time where we saw Sylvie kill him in the show."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgMJGv4cQl8-q71AyFeFmtg", "description": "Loki's season finale gave us some answers, but left us with even more questions.
