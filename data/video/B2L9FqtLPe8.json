Its been four years since Coven ended and the coven must've grew since then, and Billie is one of these new witches. She should have her own badass power, nothing like the seven wonders, something unique and cool. Maybe instead of Pyrokinesis she could control ice, Cryokinesis. Papa Legba should return, but not through the power of Witchcraft. Voodoo is the magic that conjures him and besides I think this season should introduce new gods and deites, like Santa Muerte. Santa Muerte is a deity of death in Mexican culture, she is more prominent during The Day of the Dead, which is during Halloween.", "wasn't Billie's name in Cult Winter not Willow? or am I experiencing a Mandala Effect in real time? lol", "your theories are always more interesting than what actually happens lol", "What a great video, Mary. Love your theories. Ryan should definitely hire you as a writer for AHS. \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb", "\"Her vision\" sounds like \"The sight\" that Cordelia has. It is a rare power. And I agree about Madison's powers. But I think there was a mention that some witch power is dampened and disabled in sudden and scary times of crisis."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheFr..."}
