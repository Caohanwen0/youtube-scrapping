Maybe that's because they're actually creating spinoff movies, where we get SEVERAL Avengers team. One on Earth, one in space,  one that's magic-you get the idea. And we have the perfect guy to lead the Space Avengers: Thor. He would gather together heroes like the Captains Marvel, Silver Surfer, and whatever Guardians o4 the Galaxy you got laying around. This is something we'd LOVE to see in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nIf you're new, Subscribe! \u2192 "}
