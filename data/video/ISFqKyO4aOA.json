She only has plot significance for episode 7 really,  but that's all she needs. A truly beautiful character, enigmatic and alluring. She empathizes with humans regardless of their past deeds and offers a peaceful and dignified end. I squee my pants whenever she appears. I hope one day in another season we see her again. Also, the relationship and origins of both Shachath and Satan remain shrouded, being stated more as a matter of fact. I really appreciated that. Not everything supernatural needs an explanation.", "Wish I was there but I was sleeping :("], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "VIDEO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ASYLUM/AMERICAN HORROR STORY!!!\n\nBeyond the Horror: Asylum, is an unofficial American Horror Story Live Review Show.
