Catra was my favorite character from the start and that continued throughout the show as she became more relatable", "Catra is so much more than just some toxic monster. There's a reason why an overwhelming number of abuse victims in the fandom identify with her despite her actions and behavior.", "A part that really hit me was when Catra said \u201cI don\u2019t care anymore. Some people have a bad day. I\u2019ve had a bad life. If I want something, its taken from me. If I win a fight, I lose the war. Threats only work on someone who has something to loose. But me? I\u2019ve already lost it all. And you can\u2019t be any good at this, because you let yourself get distracted. So, what\u2019ll it be?\u201d", "Catradora haters: \"Their relationship is toxic and is an insult to people in abusive relationships\" \nActual abusive victims: \"She-Ra helped me to understand myself and heal so much. Inject this show into my veins, actually.\"", "I still crack up when Catra refers too She-ra as a \u201cgiant sword lady\u201d"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC2Bw649-AJJWJDX74f85qg", "description": "traumatized kids deserve compassion. including cartoon cats.\n\nall music by jakob ahlbom\n\n\n\nmy twitter: "}
