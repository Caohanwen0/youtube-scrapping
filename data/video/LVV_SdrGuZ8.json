Great series. Started watching  them  again just watched the one when Tom dies cried like a baby. Again Great post.", "This was an absolutely superb edit. You didn\u2019t just encapsulate Tom and Liz\u2019s Journey, you did the entire trajectory of her relationship with Readington along with the dynamic between Readington and Tom which turned out to be very ironic because despite how much they hated each other and their fraught history when they actually were willing to put aside their differences and work together for the common goal they made a really good team", "This is incredible, thank you so much for making this\u2764\ufe0f", "I loved  this  couple so much! I so wanted the writers not to kill Tom, even if he disappeared from the show for a while,come back to have his happy with Liz and Agnes.", "FINALLY together!
