He had for millennia. The cold of a world bereft of Heaven's light. He had fallen in to it, a long time ago, at the beginning of all things. I watched as he plummeted, hapless human vessel shivering against the ice of an unfamiliar world - but I did not send him there alone. I let the sun follow him. An angel whom he would one day come to love, if he deemed himself deserving of his warmth.

I wanted to do another animatic since I released Icarus, though obviously I couldn't do something with the same level of quality in the same amount of time. So here's Ms. Believer. \n\nNow I should probably get to work on my portfolio."}
