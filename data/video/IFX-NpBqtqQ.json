The last teaser looked liked Gaga as well. I am hoping she is in. AHS Apocalypse is going to be awesome.", "It sounds like Sarah Paulson (towards the end you can tell it's not Gaga, it's Paulson), so it's probably either Paulson's character Cordelia and or Venable with others chanting along for a summoning ritual. I hear something in the chant that goes, \"we invoke the queen of queens\" followed by the deities name said twice like in the rest of the video.", "The anticipation grows...stronger!
