Also I don't know how anyone else felt about the dialogue but to me it was weird...like it didn't feel like humans talking, instead it felt like people speaking tediously. Almost poetically. Perhaps because we are viewing things from his memories and therefore everything feels \"artificial\" but it made it all feel very clunky and it was difficult for me to become invested.", "This was one of the best bad written movies like even tho you dont really know whats going on in some parts its still really engaging", "I'm really tired of the sexy, female love interest who speaks in eloquent prose that the male interest just falls massively in love with in 3 days."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "In this video we take a deep dive, review, recap and explain the ending to HBO Max and Warner Bros.
