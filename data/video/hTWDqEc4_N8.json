It proved that the machine wasn't just a complex program following its coding, nor a cold calculating intelligence that was just trying to fulfill its assigned mandate. Harold succeeded in teaching it to value human life as more than just a possession or a potential asset. It loved us, and him specifically so truly that it would risk its own continued existence to save him and root.", "Anyone else like pausing to see the numbers when the machine gives probabilities for survival? \n\nAlso... funny thing, Finch usually has a pretty high survival rate when this happens. Interesting because he is the least skilled combat, but even the Machine knows that pretty much anyone he is surrounded by would die to save him... good group of friends Harold!", "''That thing you've created''\nC'mon Finch, show some respect to your enemy.", "FANTASTIC THANKS FOR VIDEO!!", "When the SUV's passed them why didnt they just shoot Harold and Root from out of the window? They already knew the location of the machine?"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHFxWRvzM-oBVh93LujiFQ", "description": "Will Samaritain destroy the Machine ?"}
