Just wow. Can you hear my heart breaking", "The letter of 1:50\n\n\nDear Aziraphale", "The different colours you used throughout this video is wonderful as it conveys the emotions and the current setting. Your artstyle has always been so pleasing to look at. But I think this is the best I have seen so far. The storyline pairs so well with the music that you have chosen so its just perfect. It's amazing how much details and expression you put into everything and I love it so much. You're fantastic at what you do ^_^"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-qDi7Q_QrTnhtdsTY97TLw", "description": "This was a project that started from a Good Omens fanfic by seaskystone on tumblr\nthe series has 7 parts and this is part 3.\nI made a comic on part 1"}
