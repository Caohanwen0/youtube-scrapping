Wouldn't you think that the Apocalypse would be the biggest crisis of them all. That would make all witches extremely powerful, and think about how powerful Cordelia would be because she's the supreme.", "\"In each generation there is one woman who employs countless gifts, some say , all of them. She is the Supreme\" -Cordelia Fox S1E1:Coven", "If there are multiple Supremes, does that mean there are multiple councils? One for each school? When the council came to confront Fiona it seemed like she was THE Supreme and not one of many", "Awesome theory video! \n\nI also have a theory: If Scathach somehow lost her powers, the Salem witches would lose their powers as well since they are her descendants and inherited her \u201cgod-given\u201d magic. Also, Queenie has both voodoo and witchcraft ancestry, which is why she is able to practice both", "just a correction: the first picture is not a sketch of Tituba, it's a sketch of Filipino hero Melchora Aquino \ud83d\udc9e"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nImages by Danny Vera.
