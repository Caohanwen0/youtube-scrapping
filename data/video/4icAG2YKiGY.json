It made no sense and was never explained, and everything else just sort of fell apart after that moment. \nThe reveal and resolution of Cynthia (when Lommie locked her away) would have been fine if they'd then pivoted more strongly toward the Volcryn and it's effects on the crew's psychology. In fact it would have been great if they'd brought the Volcryn and Cynthia stories together by having the crew utilise the latter to help resolve the former. But that didn't happen and the Volcryn \"effect\" was never fully realised, which left those last few episodes feeling pretty flat.", "I just became aware of this show yesterday, and binged it in two days. On day one I was thrilled, so great, much excitement. Just finished the last episode and my literal reaction to the end scene was \"Oh fu*k off...\"", "You've hit the nail on the head with this AWESOME review. Watched every episode hoping for a satisfying pay off, but it never came. Nightflyers was just a huge pair of blue balls."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "Were you as disappointed in Netflix's \"Nightflyers\" as I was?
