WE NEED THEORIES GO!", "To help anyone who is wondering what this is, this is an allusion to Nosferatu. Nosferatu is the silent film equivalent to Dracula, named Nosferatu to avoid copyright. It's safe to say that the new season's monsters will include vampires. This fits in line with the Salem's Lot style of location, which is a vampire story written by Stephen King. I hope this cleared some stuff up for people.", "I can\u2019t wait to see how this \u201cNosferatu\u201d theme plays out!! Such a wonderful, scary film.", "I think this hopefully will be a season about monsters", "Was that Nosferatu carrying a coffin?!?!?!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClGiNHyDZPm4jEOo9UyP5Zw", "description": ""}
