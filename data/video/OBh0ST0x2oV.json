Sarah Paulson plays the character in a dramatic reenactment to make the story more lively!", "Although it is called horror, theres more to the show than just being scary. That's why season 4 is my second favorite. Season 2 being my top since it was a great mix of all things horror, character development and story telling. Season 1 was cool but falls bland in comparison to the story aspect.", "And I wanted to say I'm so glad you react to about half of the shows I watch lol I love your reactions", "Im really excited about this season. It seems like they're getting back to the basic horror and storytelling that made seasons 1 and 2 so good. The fact that they're parodying all of those crazy docudramas on the Discovery and ID channels is pretty funny to me as well.
