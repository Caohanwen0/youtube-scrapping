It sucks to have to skip through all that", "Did you notice how Michael says \"Which is\" in the first episode? It sounds a lot like \"witches\". Then a pause, and he finishes his sentence. Thought something was gonna be said about them.", "If we get a new Supreme, I think it'll end up being Adina Porter. The opening titles always have things hidden in their name cards. Adinas is a flower blossoming like the blossoming of a powerful supreme! And it's incentive for her to finally become a full cast member this season.", "i loved the fact they played 'Tonight You Belong To me' at the very end of the episode it gave me goosebumps.", "Wouldn't it be really cool if instead of Miss Venable it was Ally Richards (Sarah's \"Cult\" character) leading Outpost 3??? Because at the end of Cult, it was implied that she was in a cult and maybe that cult grew really powerful and survived the apocalypse"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nImages by Danny Vera.
