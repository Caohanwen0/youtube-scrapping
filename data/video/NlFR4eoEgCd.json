Then picked it up again somewhere in 2002 watching Brad Pitt being restrained in slooow-motion in the movie 'Snatch'. Then in 2009, caught Dennis Quaid in a shooting incident in the Sahara desert in the movie \"Flight of the Phoenix\",in slooow-motion too. Finally, I HAD to find out which Artist is responsible for this mesmerizing song. It's my playlist now. (Love the 8D version too!)", "Greatest electronic track I've ever heard. But my knowledge in electronic music is still not more than moderate.", "You can barely hear the little background noises and knocks and things on low quality versions of this.
