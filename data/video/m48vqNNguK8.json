It is so intelligent and emotional", "WTF?! The performances by the actors are fantastic on this show. If you are not impressed by anyone, you must be impressed by Michael Emerson at least!", "My favorite character is Root! She's so wonderful and unpredictable, plus she looks awesome with two guns. I think the season one is the least favorite but once it reach to season two it became in a super wonderful fun series", "You gotta admit Fusco is the most loveable character.", "I'm just a couple episodes away from season 4. Season 3 has been my favorite so far. Shaw is my favorite character for sure."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs-EtUXcsnFykm4wCozN_yQ", "description": "If you like talking about TV, Consider subscribing: http://bit.ly/HarnikTalks\n\nIGN Article: http://bit.ly/1OMmyuo"}
