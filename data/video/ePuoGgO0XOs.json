Stepping up when it mattered to help Lucifer, and his dancing was wonderfully awkward.", "So God made sure Chloe was born so that Lucifer could learn to fall in love. God's plan was for Lucifer to learn what love really is, so Lucifer fought for love instead of hatred, jealously, or spite like he did when he first fell. He changed so much because of love that God himself was proud of the man he has become since being on earth. Lucifer changed so much that he even sacrifices himself for Chloe, for love.. which in turn would make him become worthy of being given the power of God, only someone that understands love should have the power. Thats why Michael couldn't be worthy, he tried to take control and become god through Fear.  Lucifer wasn't ready until right at the end when he finally could say I love you and actually mean it because he only tells the truth. Its all very poetic really."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "In this video we take a deep dive, review, recap and explain the ending to Netflix's LUCIFER Season 5 part 2 as well as offer theories and predictions for Season 6.\n\nCheck out my other horror breakdowns here: "}
