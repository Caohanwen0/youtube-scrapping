I despise ruby, the son was annoying, bad acting.

The rest didn't happen.", "I adore how meta it was, basically Ryan & Brad making fun of themselves. Agreed Addie was a total waste. I wish Murder House would have imploded though. Done with it.", "First, I totally want to see a Telltale game about AHS now thanks to this episode, with the idea of every chapter based on each season of it, or an RPG game based on it. I would love that. \ud83d\ude05\n\nAnd second, I think that episode felt rushed and dugging more holes to the plot, it shouldn't have existed and the whole 'burning the MH down' should have kept for the series finale.
