They are amazing. From Jessica Lange, Angela Bassett, Kathy Bates, and my absolute favorite Sarah Paulson. It's like they pull something from each other and extraordinary things happen in front of the camera. My favorite season, and my favorite show as a whole of all time.", "holy shit myrtle's voice IS SO DIFFErENTNTNTNT", "The first and favorite season I ever saw of AHS! So happy they\u2019re doing a Coven, Murder House crossover yes!", "Misty Day broke my heart in the best way, Madison was a roller-coaster, Zoe was perceptive, Cordelia endured the worst and Marie Leveu (Pardon My Spelling) had SUCH a powerful role in all of it, it's probably the best if not second best, BUT HEY \n "], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqTjq8HiM0gc8eAww1jqXJQ", "description": "Take a look behind the scenes of Coven with the actors.\n\nNo copyright infringement.\nThis is strictly for viewing purposes.\nI don't own this video.\nAll the rights belong to FX."}
