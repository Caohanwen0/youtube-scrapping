We haven\u2019t had something really good in a while so I\u2019m excited", "The reason Lark is able to take the pill isn\u2019t because of her dentistry it\u2019s because she\u2019s a tattoo artist. I still think the black pill is dependent on a persons creativity not just any general talent.", "The drug isn't really that broad, seeing as Lark is a tattoo artist as well and she mentioned that the drug causes people from all over the world coming to get her art tattooed on them. She also then mentions that the drug works for various types of creative and artistic people.", "This review jumped to A LOT of conclusions from just two episodes.Personally, I see a good story here. The debut episodes do.a fine job of establishing the premise, making me care about the characters, and getting me interested enough to tune in next week.

Honestly, I don't know if American Horror Stories (the AHS Spinoff) was just that bad or these episodes are just that good. Either way, this was a great start to a promising season. Not without its problems, but I'm happy at what we saw.\nTwitter: "}
