After Fringe, you're spoiling us .... saw the thumbnails and instant clicked to hit like :) \nVery nice story arcs, first few episodes may seem a bit slow or too \"crime of the week\" but it gets better as it gains momentum... worth watching all the way!", "First time I watched this show dubbed in russian, but then rewatched it in english just to hear Michael Emerson's voice. Idk why but his voice and delivery is magical, much like Anthony Hopkins's.", "This along with fringe are my 2 fav shows of all time most likely. With PoI the first bit is a bit procedural but then it gets really, REALLY, REALLY good. The plot expands so much in this show it's amazing. It basically goes from good to one of the best plots I've ever seen.", "Quite frankly this was the best written TV show I've seen in a while. I love shows like Lost, Fringe and Lucifer but after re watching the entire 5 seasons with my son recently this his gone to my favourite TV show. Each season has a story arc with one overall story arc for the entire 5 seasons tying everything together plus this show is one of the few that managers to pull off a satisfying ending.", "I'm always happy to see a reactor begin the journey into Person of Interest.  One of my favourite shows, and it just gets better and better  :)"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyfxz9guQi3lDWMZ76Y5fMA", "description": "Person Of Interest Episode 1x1 'Pilot'  (Part 1) | REACTION & REVIEW\n\nWatch Part 2 Here: https://youtu.be/_YpXLuw3slA"}
