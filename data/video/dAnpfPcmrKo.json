I loved every episode, character, and performance. Evan peters better get some recognition come award season. So sad it's over and we have to wait until next september for season 8", "I really enjoyed this season. This was my 2nd favorite. I really enjoyed how this season didnt have supernatural elements. Although I enjoy the supernatural elements, it was a nice break from it. Great Video, Mary!", "These are my thoughts, the season started out well and left me excited for the next episode. About mid-season  I recall people commenting the same as I felt that this could be one of the best seasons to date. However, when the plot took the turn and began the real life cult portrayals the season somehow lost its momentum and I believe never really recovered. Regrettably I would have to put this season at number six on my list of favorites.", "been missing the live streams personal issues going on, but i LOVED the season just wasn\u2019t happy with the ending of this season, the cliffhanger. Coven is still my all time favorite though"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "VIDEO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR American Horror Story, Season 7, Episode 11!!!\n\nPetition Link to MAKE MARY AN AMERICAN HORROR STORY WRITER: "}
