There are no plans for a sequel and Neil Gaiman worked himself into exhaustion to make this. He's a novelist that became a show runner to grant his dear friend a last request. I figured that was that. It's a great miniseries and I'm happy with it.", "I love how Shecky wanted 'Zira and Crowley to kiss. Those are exactly my thoughts every time I watch it. I ship it too \ud83d\ude02 An angel and a demon, perfect couple. Especially after 6000 years", "Your guys's reaction to Good Omens is definitely my favorite", "Terry was a philosophical satirist. It is all about people. Coated in fantasy and very clever words.", "This reaction warmed my heart as did the certificate of completion. You guys are so funny and I loved seeing you guys lose it at the end. It's a damn good show.
