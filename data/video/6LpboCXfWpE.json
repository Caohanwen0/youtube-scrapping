She has many of her mannerisms, especially her speaking patterns.", "Charlotte can't be Caleb, since it has to be someone real Charlotte hurt \"Why do I have to be her? She hurt us.\"", "Caleb's backstory is HEAVY, holy hell. That was a tough emotional watch. Good acting.", "This missed the most interesting detail to me: the recording hale left for her son was different when she replayed it. The replay, happening at the end of the episode, seemed more human and emotional. The first time it was played lacked emotion and \u201crealness\u201d as this was likely a simulation created by Rehoboam with the second replaying being the actual recording, not a forecast/simulation created by the AI of what hale might do. The twist of the season could be that some scenes are the simulation created by rehoboam, while others are the actual reality."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "In this video we breakdown, explain, review, and recap Season 3 Episode 3 \"The Absence of Field\" of HBO's Westworld for new theories, easter eggs, and details you missed.
