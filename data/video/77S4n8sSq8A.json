This week's episode is \"Halloween, Part 1.\" Every episode gets more and more intense and I'm seriously so excited to see what this entire season of Murder House has to offer.\n\n*also, I just noticed after my video went live that one of my parts got cut out and shortened but it wasn\u2019t like that when I uploaded it, so I\u2019m not sure what happened. Sorry about that!!\n\nIf you like AHS or movie reaction channels, be sure to subscribe to my channel! I put out videos every Thursday. If you have any requests for other movies or shows you want me to watch, let me know in the comments. Also, if you want me to react to other seasons of American Horror Story, let me know which ones you want to see! Thanks for watching!"}
