And in return, he helped Finch and Root. It would be nice if we saw more past numbers help here and there during this conflict with Samaritan - it would validate the mission Finch and Reese started all those years ago and prove that people can change the world.", "The scene back in Season two between Caleb and Harold on the subway platform, was one of the more gripping dramatic moments of that season. Instead of John just showing up at the last minute to bust up some bad guys to resuce our POI of that episode, Harold got to be the \"hero\" who saved a life - and he did it by being vulnerable in a way that got through to Caleb.", "Am I the only one that cried at this scene? That just killed me.", "There needs to be a new POI spin-off with Shaw, Fusco, Caleb, Zoe, and Bear.  Throw in some Leon for comic relief.  There can even be occasional cross-overs with the team in DC put together by that billionaire play-boy.", "Luke is so hot good actor too........most underrated actor......he needs to be on the big screen more."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF3kXXD7_C8T_I4gMrfSuAQ", "description": "PERSON OF INTERST\nSeason 4, Episode 22 ''YHWH''\n...\nCaleb Phipps - Luke Kleintank\nRoot/Shannon - Amy Acker\nHarold Finch/Mr. Swift - Michael Emerson"}
