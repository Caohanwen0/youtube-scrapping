He is just evil and never is explained. Collier, Elias, and Root are given colorful backgrounds that helps the viewer understand them. Dominic is not given the same courtesy. The portrayal by Winston Duke is masterful but the writers missed the chance to explain this interesting character.", "I thought the writing and acting for this show was brilliant; as clearly witnessed here. The tension was palpable and there was even a small note of sympathy for Dominic. While I generally despised the character (in the best way) there was a moment here where I was able to glimpse something akin to vulnerability, when he asked why Alias gets a pass. It was just a second or two but that was enough. It's moments like that that really solidified Person of Interest as one of my all time favourite TV shows.", "Who knew this guy would become one of the best parts of Black Panther.", "\"You wouldn't kill an unarmed man\"\n\nOh... Dominic, you have no idea who you're dealing with!", "\"Tell me who you really are\".\n\"I'm batman\".\nHis voice seriously makes him sound like batman."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMhOOR9QQb-BvtCUh3b4dWg", "description": "Reese (Det.
