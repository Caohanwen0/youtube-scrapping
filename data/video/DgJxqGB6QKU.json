It won awards and everything but I still don't have anyone to talk to about it!", "Note: In Season 4, nearly all the titles have no punctuation at the end. Not an exclamation point, question mark, period, or even a semi-colon or ellipse. They are intentionally open-ended and defying the limitations set by punctuation.", "The bit about the labels makes me think hard about the journey Rebecca went through when she got diagnosed. Like labels can be both helpful and restricting/damaging. Also I love that you talk about the musicality of each theme song! So thoughtful!", "Why does this video have such a criminally low view count?! This was such a well thought-out analysis, and so fun to watch now that I am rewatching the show for what is at least the fourth time. Edit: I see now that it has only been up for a day, here's to many more people finding this video and liking it!", "So, I started watching this video having never watching the show before, got half way through it, and decided it sounded interesting and decided to binge watch the whole show.  I am now halfway through season 4."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC2Bw649-AJJWJDX74f85qg", "description": "this show is one of the greatest pieces of art i've ever seen in my life. thanks rachel bloom\n\noh. dedicated to wash, shai, melissa, and z. loved loving this show with all of you\n\n\nchannel twitter: twitter.com/5x5takes\nmy twitter: twitter.com/theblutomato\n\nim sure you already know, but for more youtube cxg content, PLEASE check out bagels after midnight."}
