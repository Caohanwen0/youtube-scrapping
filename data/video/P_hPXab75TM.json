I love the emotions you so clearly write on Crowley's face and the color choices too!!", "bye i have no knowledge of these characters other than they hurt me and i almost cried", "I'm not crying I just having something in my eye is all", "I really love this, it's phenomenal. Especially the way Aziraphale and Crowley cry each other's colors, like they're part of each other-- and then how the holy water container is blue, which I think is associated with heaven since the demons are a darker shade of pink and crowley is as well, just lighter, it would make sense if heaven was also tied to blue. I love the colors and the shifting between the lineart- drawing two of the same must have been timely but the outcome is amazing, gives a distraught atmosphere that now everytime I watch I immediately have tears in my eyes. Beautiful, amazing. Thank you for this masterpiece <3", "Oh lord the song was sad and the colors and the drama and AY imma go cry for a decade if your happy it was so sad..... goes to a corner and sobs grossly SEE WHAT CHA DID MY HEART ITS BROKEN keeps crying"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl1fq-TK65EKvQhkLPOlmow", "description": "oh god my FEELINGS \n\nmy last good omens video BLEW THE HELL UP OMGGGG so here\u2019s another one\n\nCrowley angst \nI swear I\u2019ll do a happy video soon\n\nHope y\u2019all like it\n\nSong: Pigeon - Cavetown\n\nInstagram: @eugiius\n\nEdit: Also yes stop asking I\u2019ve seen the ashfur amv and i heard the song from it lmAO ik the colors are similar"}
