Kai says something like \"where's your wife?\" Ally says \"Who?\" \nI'm sure this prediction is far fetched but- What if Ivy dies next episode?   I mean those 2 scenes in the trailer might be back to back for a reason. What do you think?", "Love your predictions and your channel! At this point I am just waiting for Lily Rabe", "Great predictions!\nsomething tells me that Kai is gonna kill Ivy... and that then he and Ally and Ozzy will end up together... crazy", "Jim Jones never drank the Kool-Aid in the end, His body was found with a gunshot wound to the head, He took the cowards way out after convincing those poor people to drink. Great Video as always tho :*", "I think Ozzie will the \" Messiah\". A sort of  bond was born between Ali & Kai in the last episode. He'll probably want her to be the mother of his messiah but  It is quite unlikely that she will accept to be  impregnated by him. The first reason is obvious: she's gay. The second is that we are not sure of her intention: will she become kai's accomplice or will she outsmart his system? Anyway, since he can't impregnate Ali, Kai will take interest in her son. After all, it is possible that he is the sperm donor and thus Oz's father.
