Like did he use up all of his favors with Satan when he went to get Misty?  I can\u2019t wait to see why he had to make her into a robot.", "The most interesting thing to me about this episode was when Mallory saved Coco. In another episode when Mallory saved the deer, myrtle said she didn\u2019t heal the wounds, she undid them.

Bubbles McGee has a power similar to Nan's telepathy, which is called Vlentio Animo and is the ability to read the soul of another individual.", "hey there was a lot of heart eatting this season and that is how Scath got the Butcher under her control, then obviously the Blood Moon is important."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nVIDEO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR American Horror Story, Season 8, Episode 7!!!\n\nmondaysRmurder channel link: "}
