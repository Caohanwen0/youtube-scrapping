Super grateful for the seasons we have now, they were the best. I now wish that the season 3 finally would be the setup for a movie. That would be dope.", "I won't say it's my favorite show, but it beats the hell out of the massive turd Walking Dead has become.", "This honestly just came out of nowhere (for me at least as I just found out now that it's happening). I really thought the show was doing really great and was at its pinnacle. Didn't know it was apparently sucking in season 3 compared to the first two seasons. I enjoyed all three seasons so I've had no complaints at all. Sad to see it go. Really wish it had its 5 seasons like they wanted it to."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "SIGN THE PETITION TO SAVE ASH VS EVIL DEAD: https://www.change.org/p/starz-renew-..."}
