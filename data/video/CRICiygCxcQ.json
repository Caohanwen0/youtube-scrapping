My theory, and hear me out, is that they just wanted the Maddy and incinerated Fay and Everett. The old woman\u2019s kid heard the alien words and walked out to get taken by the \u201cpeople in the sky\u201d. Maddy was ALSO a kid who had a single mother and was probably very isolated from her tiny town. And the old woman said that was the target. But Maddy wouldn\u2019t have been able to walk out to a spot where they could take her in. So the aliens orchestrated the all of the things that Fay and Everett did to take her in! The babysitter had seen the UFO hover near her house and called Fay to tell her. Fay then took Maddy with Everett and rode with the other couple who told them to get in, to the exact place with they wanted. You can later see that the couple is affected, and \u201cpossessed\u201d by the alien words but not Fay and Everett. The \u201cpeople in the sky\u201d could only take in people who were \u201cpossessed\u201d by them, so they wouldn\u2019t want Fay and Everett. So why would they go through this whole process just so Fay and Everett could be burned to ashes? They wanted MADDY!", "Don't know about radio but Fay certainly had a career in field sports. Damn you aliens, robbed her of an Olympic medal.", "I hope they make more movies in the \"Paradox theater\" , or hell, make a whole series based on that concept, Since i feel the new TwiligthZone show was a disapointment, and this would make a better show", "If you remember, Fay said she lives with a single mom. For that woman to lose both of her children mysteriously would be devastating..."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "In this video we take a deep dive and explain the ending to Amazon's latest sci-fi movie THE VAST OF NIGHT.
