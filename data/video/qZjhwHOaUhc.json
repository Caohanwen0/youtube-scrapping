The Elias arc is probably the biggest thing that makes me stand up on the \"Don't skip season one\" soap box with you, especially for an episode a little ways off still, and I forgot they do not waste any time setting it up", "one of poi's strongest points is definitely the continuity i think and so many things are being set up since s1 or early s2 really, skipping anything ruins the rest of the experience imo", "I should start rewatching the series so I can follow along better with the reviews. I love both Person of Interest and your chanel.", "came here from your Adora character analysis video(amazing video btw, such an amazing show that blew my mind and your video made me tear up again), so glad that you are talking about Person of Interest as well, this show doesn't get nearly the praise it deserves, one of the most rewatchable series for me along with Shera and Korra. God can I just say it again how amazing your videos are and I'm now dying to see more of them", "Five by Five takes, you continue to produce videos with the best writing on YouTube, and I cannot wait for your next one.
