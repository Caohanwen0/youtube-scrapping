It was extremely disturbing. Season 3 was too comedic and very....teenage sitcom feels :p disappointed", "Everyone says that this season was horrible. I liked it.", "I get so frustrated when people complain about how Coven wasn't scary blah blah blah....it was still horror, but a different KIND of horror. Third season dealt more with realistic horrors in society like racism, women's rights, teenage hormones out of wack, finding one's purpose, betrayal, etc. No there weren't any monsters jumping out at you, but Coven did deliver some great stories and a pretty complex plotline that seemed to never end. Not every season is going to be identical on scare factor; that's why each one is a different story, characters, setting, and so on. Give Coven some credit! It was a great season for different reasons! ", "No matter what ANYBODY says...this is the best season.", "These trailers all have that weird/freaky factor, however the season so far has not, if anything I've found it quite comedic/ too obviously gruesome. Slightly disappointed... "], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClGiNHyDZPm4jEOo9UyP5Zw", "description": "OFFICIAL PROMO of Ryan Murphy's TvSeries.
