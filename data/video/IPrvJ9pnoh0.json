A battle between the anti-Christ and the coven to decide the fate of the world. Could call it something like... \nAmerican Horror Story: Supreme", "Also maybe a clue to Evan playing Michael could be the fact he\u2019s a hair dresser. Think back to season 1 when constance left Michael with the baby sitter, where was she? A hair salon \ud83d\udc87\u200d\u2640\ufe0f! Is the theme AHS Hair Salon lol?! Jk but it could be a little clue \ud83e\uddd0", "A few hours ago there was an influx of articles claiming Emma Roberts is heavily hinting that she's returning AS Madison Montgomery, not just returning in general to play a new character or anything. So it's pretty much a shoe in that at least one dead witch is coming back. That makes me really hopeful for Misty Day. I'm like almost begging for her to return lol.", "If your flip the number 8 over it looks like an infinity sign and I think it\u2019s about the legba hell limbo cause ya know they\u2019re there for infinity?", "I wasn't particularly a fan of Cult (although I will say it was positively hilarious at times) but I did enjoy it because honestly I'm trash for AHS. I'll watch till it's bitter end. But this season has me more hyped than ever before!!!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": ""}
