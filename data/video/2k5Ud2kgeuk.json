I have been watching every week.  Episode 6 will return in 2 weeks.  Idk why it is taking a week off.  The first 5 episodes are great, though they do not follow the conventional linear timeline, so beware!  Major time jumps around back and fourth with the murders.  The acting is very stellar \ud83d\udc4d", "btw Mary. I know it's a while away. but I definitely hope you review the new Halloween movie coming out October 19th. Idk if your a Michael Myers fan or not but would definitely love to hear your input.", "The only thing I've watched from TNT was a tiny bit of Rizzoli & Isles lmao"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "Host is MaryGirl Moody.
