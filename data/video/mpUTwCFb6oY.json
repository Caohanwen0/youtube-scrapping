He's the Antichrist.  It will be kinda like \"The Omen\" vs. \"Coven\" perhaps.  That would be AMAZING!\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd42\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udf88", "I have an theory. Since Lady Gaga played Scathage in the reenactment and the OG Supreme IS unknown, maybe Sarah Paulson plays Scathage and since she's a powerful witch, she could most likely bring back all the witches that died, since Ryan asked ALL the witches back.", "I want Lana del Rey to be in this season. She would be the perfect og supreme", "Here's my theory: the first 5 episodes will be with totally new characters... (Evan as a hairstylist and Sarah with dental apps) and we'll see the real crossover only after episode 5, as Ryan said that a BIG thing happens on this episode. Kind of what happened in Roanoke with the twist.", "I want misty to come back \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude2d"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheFr..."}
