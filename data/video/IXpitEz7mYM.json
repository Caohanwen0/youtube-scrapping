I have been working through how to respond to the viewpoint of the show and I think you have it spot on", "Very well said. This is a comedy, based on a book by two very well renowned fantasy authors. The authors don't expect anyone, christian or not, to think the way the story is portrayed is not ridiculous. This is not meant to be an expos\u00e9 on religious beliefs.", "I love this video because it is exactly what i felt about this show. It\u2019s a good show! Obviously there are some huge theological differences but like also....\nTo Christians who rant against this show, it\u2019s written by a non-Christian, why are you expecting a sermon? \ud83d\ude02 I watched this with my dad whose a southern baptist pastor and we loved it! We were there for some comedy and prodding theological questions about the nature of angels and demons, not for spiritual wisdom!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjwJMzkkVyXg3BNGUMcT0g", "description": "#GoodOmens \n\nA Christian group has petitioned Netflix to pull Good Omens from its streaming service, despite the fact its actually on Amazon Prime. Here Christian minister, Glen Scrivener, responds to the controversy and its Christians themselves that are in for criticism.\n\nGood Omens portrays a ridiculous picture of heaven and hell, largely because too many Christians have proclaimed a ridiculous picture of heaven and hell. In this video we see that heaven does not fight hell to destroy the world. Heaven triumphs over hell to save the earth. THAT\u2019s a good story.\n\nspeaklife.org.uk"}
