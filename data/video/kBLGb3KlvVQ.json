It's American Horror Story, not American Sci-Fi Story. Personally, I don't find aliens scary. Horror, to me, is about ghosts, demons, witches, vampires, and such. The best idea for next season, that I've heard so far, is dolls coming to life or possessed dolls. I find dolls creepy. Some people have referred to it as a Dollhouse season.", "I want to see AHS: Faerie. We've seen angels in season 2, and explored more deeply the powers of hell and Satan himself throughout AHS. We've glimpsed the aliens from the greater cosmos, now we should see what's in between. Faeries in mythology were sometimes referred to as aliens, as where they come from is another plane. Maybe it's where the witches get their magic from?", "I just read a short story on your website,  I loved it! You are very talented! I need to start making these live streams.", "I missed it! But I'm excited to get the novels! Can't wait for Aliens! You look BEAUTIFUL Mary!
