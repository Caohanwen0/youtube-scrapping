That bee pic from Ryan\u2019s Instagram was credited to the person he regrammed it from, he never said it was from AHS, like that 48 Star flag pic, too.\nNo Denis, Lily, Kathy, Angela... I missed them but this season benefited from not being as \u201cStar\u201d crowded as the last two. Definitely want Billy Eichner, Billie Lourd, & Leslie Grossman to become part of the AHS family!", "Kathy &. Dennis as meadow and harrison would have been AWESOME... I can just picture Kathy at the table with Kai doing the pinky thing. Lmao", "I think Ally borrowed a lot of character traits from Lana Winters and Cordelia Goode. With being a lesbian, insecure, and her story ending being a powerful figure in America. Lana is a pop culture icon, Cordelia is a leader of women (Witches), and Ally is a political figure (Senator). Ally is like if Lana and Cordelia had a surrogate baby.", "I missed the live stream"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "Welcome to American Horror Story Weekly Wednesday Live Streams!
