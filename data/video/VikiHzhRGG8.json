It doesn't get much better than this!  VERY disappointed this show was only nominated for 1 Emmy - for Sound Editing (they deserved it)!  Very few shows can hold a candle to this one.  Thank you JJ Abrams for the concept and the remarkable Michael Emerson & Jim Caviezel for bringing it all to life for us!  Best New Drama!  Best Actors!  Best Supporting Actors!  Best Direction!  Best Writing!\nPeriod.", "One of the best series ever!Great action from Jim Caviezel and Michael Emerson!Love when jogn fights and Fints with his magic at computers!", "John is so beautiful... and his voice? OMG", "That flaskback with Jessica chokes me everytime! Makes me wonder how many times love is silent", "I just want to THANK-YOU from the bottom of my heart!!!! For me, person of interest is the greatest show of all time, and having this video is such a gift!
