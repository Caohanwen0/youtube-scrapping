Daniel Craig's Bond is going to be missed after this Grand Finale \ud83e\udd35\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udca5", "This is definitely one of the greatest edits I've seen. I hope you will make more Bond edits nonetheless. I will definitely miss Daniel Craig as Bond.", "It's a great montage, but man, what is it with that music choice? If this had anything reminiscent of Bond (Bond title song, Bond theme, a piece from a Bond film soundtrack) this would be among my favourite 007 tributes. Don't take it personal, it's just my personal opinion with some constructive criticism. As for the editing - awesome work and good choice of scenes!", "heck, I love the choice of music so much, whoever says anything against it! great, I like everything! epic, excellent editing, music breathed like music from the black widow trailer, seriously \ud83d\ude00 \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "I enjoyed it\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf78 \nGood work\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udd25"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8K1-uC3NazkioWBnDk_5w", "description": "A montage fan made video for James Bond with Daniel Craig.
