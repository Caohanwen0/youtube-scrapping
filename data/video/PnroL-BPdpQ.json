They\u2019re all such underrated actors, whenever anybody leaves the cast and comes back like Taissa and Jessica have, always kills me", "\u201cThe stew is stu\u201d is still one of my favourite lines", "This makes it all the more confusing when every major character has like the same actor", "I got to say, a speed cut like this is really tough to follow when a show consisting of tens of important characters are all played by a cast of the same 5 actors", "I only saw Murder House..... Apparently I saw the tamest of all the seasons."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRgUg0jJUgGMadGPzzmu8cw", "description": "Ever wonder how all the events of American Horror Story fit into one timeline?
