One of the moments I enjoyed best tho would be the first time the song sings \"Feel so right doing the wrong thing, feel so wrong doing the right thing\" - the first clip set is obviously fun (as Reese is often enjoying the dark side of his job), but the choice of the clip where Elias puts the baby in the freezer truck to extract info - I'm not sure there's a better moment in the series to illustrate the \"Feels so wrong doing the right thing\" moment as that was. Excellent pick there. Great job overall.", "Honestly not too sure how the hell I haven't come across this before, but hey better late than never!!!!!
