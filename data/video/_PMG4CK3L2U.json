Do a series incorporating Native American folklore (skinwalkers, Coyote, Raven). That would be amazing.", "I'd say a Wendigo would be a really cool monster to have.  They did kinda have that cannibal family in the Roanoke season, but I'd love to see a full-on Wendigo be introduced.  There's so much you could do with something like that."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg", "description": "Top 10 Monsters We Want to See on American Horror Story\nSubscribe: http://goo.gl/Q2kKrD and also Ring the Bell to get notified // Have a Top 10 idea?
