I felt like they were giving us an 80s slasher flick, and the second half was the over-the-top sequel.", "I\u2019m excited for AHS: Surf and Turf!", "I'm not mad at the title. I trust Ryan Murphy. He knows what he's doing. Im very happy about the 2 seasons in one concept. Ryan is definitely giving the fans what we want..which is more content and more AHS. I can't wait for this \" double season\" to start and This totally explains why filming and production is taking so long. I'll wait.", "Really sad about Kathy Bates, but of course she should take care of herself. She can star in future seasons! \ud83d\ude03"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewQ7lWhXppncBm76lVIVbA", "description": "The title of the highly anticipated tenth season of American Horror Story has been revealed as 'Double Feature', and an AHS vet has been announced to be returning for the season.
