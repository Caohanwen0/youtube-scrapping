Thank You Mary my fellow Sagittarius Texan!! You made my day \ud83d\ude01\u2764\ufe0f", "Wait! I have another connection: it takes place next year... maybe it takes place at the same time as next years coven/murder house season? And it acts as a transition season that sets up the plot for the next season while still having a plot of its own?", "It\u2019s awesome that we are going back to asylum, coven style. Roanoke did have its moments, but very little else, and cult was just unwatchable and awful, so bad it almost made me abandon the series. I even suspected that Ryan Murphy was attempting to murder the show. But I\u2019m going to allow for for one last chance , after two dud seasons (2years) . Will try to catch the live show, hope the books are selling well, I heard Joan Collins has had real life ghost encounters, I\u2019m sure she will be bitchy as hell, hope Jessica Lange comes back to reprise some past characters. And wish that they will offer closure for some characters (ghost queenie, pepper, ) also wonder if the show has made you a writer yet,? Awesome stream as always.", "BRAZIL HERE \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c Love ur videos!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nWelcome to American Horror Story Weekly Wednesday Live Stream!
