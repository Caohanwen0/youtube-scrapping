The basic premise of Person of Interest was very similar to shows like Have Gun Will Travel, The Fugitive, The Equalizer, and even The Incredible Hulk and The A Team. The hero(s) find or are sought out by people in trouble and they help them. The fact that POI went a little further made this show special.", "I always felt sorry for the Machine, but never knew why. This helped explain that.\nAnd in the end,  she ask for Harold's approval one last time", "It's great how the writers took this line and totally turned it on it's head. I remember back in season 1, one of the last things John said to Jessica was that \"in the end we're all alone, and nobody's coming to save you\". But now, at the end of their journey, John is there for Harold and he was able to save him.", "This is arguably the greatest series finale ever. It inspires hope and taught me that we all transcend death, and that we are all luminous beings with unfathomable potential. This kind of hope and optimism, and empowerment is whats missing in the world"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRBOalILM5dcN5P_unVZGSw", "description": "POI: 5x13"}
