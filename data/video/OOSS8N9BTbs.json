SO HYPED to see this.", "The last film I saw in the theatre was \u201cThe Call\u201d, the thriller with Tobin Bell and Lin Shaye, it was a fine experience. I think \u201cSpiral\u201d would definitely be a big deal as a theatre release because horror is a wonderful way to deal with all of those complicated feelings during last year and this year. The streaming thing could also work because I\u2019ll be getting whichever platform it releases on if it goes that route and I think many fans will join me in that sentiment \ud83d\ude01 We shall see. I\u2019m excited either way and I\u2019ve been promoting the film to people whenever I get a chance \ud83d\ude0e Thanks for the great video as always!", "I don't think Spiral will be going to streaming, at least not until they decide to delay it again. But, in the current conditions for cinema, could do well. It's a big enough movie to draw people in (especially with SLJ and Chris Rock) but not to big where it will only lose money. The only issue is with that budget, if it cost them $40 million to make then it will likely need to make $80 million in the box office just to break even. If it had to go to a streaming service I imagine it would go to Netflix, Shudder is definitely a better fit but Netflix has a wider audience and has been generally kind to horror movie fans.", "I was waiting for this particular content as I\u2019m a huge fan of the Saw franchise.
