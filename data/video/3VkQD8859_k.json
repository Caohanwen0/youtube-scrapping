She was working for the government managing security clearances; Finch deduces from cell phone information that she was killed by Vigilance. Their next number, prosecutor Matthew Reed (Nestor Carbonell), comes soon after, and Reese and Shaw are dispatched to a high school reunion in Westchester. They manage to prevent the planned murder from happening, even while fending off an ambush by Vigilance. Meanwhile, Finch and Fusco go to Washington, D.C. to find out why Leona was targeted, but Vigilance beats them to it, and Peter Collier obtains classified documents about the Machine, which he leaks to the press. Senator Ross Garrison (John Doman) publicly denies existence of the Machine, while ordering Control to shut the program down. The Machine responds by redirecting the relevant numbers to Root instead.\n\nApril 1, 2014"}
