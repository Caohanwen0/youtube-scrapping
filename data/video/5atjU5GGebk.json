He was really smart of course, and I do like him, but I can understand why you put him where you did. ", "Strahm is the most bad-ass good guy in the whole franchise.

Earlier this year, Josiah passed away, leaving behind his wife, daughter and unborn child. Given the decade that this year has been, we wanted to see what we could do to help his family by honoring his memory and raising a little money in the process.\n\nI know times our tough right now but anything will help. All benefits will go directly to Josiah's wife and donations can get you some cool SAW stuff!"}
