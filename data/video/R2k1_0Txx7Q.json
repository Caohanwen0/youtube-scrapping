If you don't agree, that's fine.", "They were talking (the ghosts in episode 7) about mediums going to camp redwood,that could be a nod to Sarah paulson coming in for one episode and Evan peters playing billy idol would be amazing,I don\u2019t think this season has been the same without them,though billie lourd and Emma Roberts have done a brilliant job at keeping it afloat,love your channel,can\u2019t wait for the next video \ud83d\ude00"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "Time to breakdown and review American Horror Story's episode 8 preview \"Rest in Pieces\" where we look for clues, theories, and easter eggs for what the show has in store.\n\nLink to the trailer: "}
