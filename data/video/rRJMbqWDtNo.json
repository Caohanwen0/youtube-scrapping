In the beginning you can see a flash to her in bed (maybe a younger version of herself?)", "I think that\u2019s Richard Ramirez that was on Brooke\u2019s (Emma) bed also the woman under the umbrella is frances conroy I think \u2764\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f", "I noticed that the killer didint look like he did in the promos he had an almost identical outfit that the killer had in I know what you did last summer and in this trailer the group hit someone with their car also like the group did in I know what you did last summer so I wonder if this season will be a heavily based serial killer season now that we know there are already 3 kilkers. Mr Jingles, Richard Ramirez and whoever is the black hooded outfit. I am so excited for this season", "Can't wait for this season!", "Okay I just gotta couple things to get off my chest:\n\n1.
