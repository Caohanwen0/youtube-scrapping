Taraji and Jim just clicked. They were the show and I would've loved to have seen her in the show longer than 2 and a half seasons. But Empire came a knocking and she took a chance. Jim is such an emotional man and you saw it in his face when he found out she was leaving. Even Michael Emerson. Now that tells you how great of a person Taraji is. I missed her so much on POI. She just brought out the best in everyone. Because she had her own characteristics in her character. Made Jim smile more. I tell the truth I stopped watching after season 3. And only saw a few of 4 and like 5 episodes of 5. Just wasn't the same without Taraji. CaReese all day everyday.", "Jim stared at taraji as he had feelings for her. he seemed very uncomfortable , near to tears.", "There aren't a lot of tv shows that make me cry but damn Person of Interest got me good with Carter's death - this show is one of the best crime drama shows that has ever been on tv, I wish it could last forever!", "Jim and Taraji have the best chemistry...  Jim cares about her so much....I hope they work together again,like plzzzz make it happen"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPTu6NY2a3RR_umbSkHTTeQ", "description": "From Person of Interest Season 3 Bluray package, about Carter's death."}
