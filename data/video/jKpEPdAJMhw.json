But, I also love how you told those, who take the show way too seriously and who have no sense of humor, to go fuck off! Lol.

Then, they'll even fight with those who happen to disagree with them.", "I totally hate that I work tomorrow in Madison's hell. Y'all enjoy it for me. If it is not a cliffhanger, I pray to the Goddess that it blows us away.
