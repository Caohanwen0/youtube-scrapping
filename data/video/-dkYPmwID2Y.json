Her love of Stevie Nicks is just an added bonus. Definitely my top favorite of Lily Rabe's AHS roles.", "Always kinda pissed me off Misty died, mean I understood why they did it because next to Cordillia she was the true contender for the status of Supreme because she was the only one that could have possibly performed all seven wonders besides her. Sucked she died because she was the true vision of a witch and pagan in the show. Granted I know that both black and white, good and evil exist but Misty portrayed the pure light of Witchcraft that made you want her to live and to be the supreme. Really wishing Roanoke would come on Netflix or Amazon Prime since it includes something about the original Supreme in it or so I've read.", "\"I'll forgive you\" \nI just died XD Misty is just there chilling as always xD", "I love misty, and her greatest idol Fleetwood Mac/Stevie Nicks. \u2764"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGIQHvkZPzrna7UHtmlgoXw", "description": "American horror story coven - misty finds zoe  and offers to look after Kyle and heal him\n3x2 boy parts"}
