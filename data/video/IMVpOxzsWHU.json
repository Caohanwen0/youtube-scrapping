Have to say this is the most beautiful moment I\u2019ve ever seen. Sweet Misty being saved from Hell when I thought she would be trapped forever, only to be rescued and delivered to her own personal heaven. I almost cried watching this", "The Nostalgia is mind bending!! This song, this scene, this setting, I can\u2019t stop crying!!", "Misty Day was so well cast and acted. She always made me think of some other-wordly ephemeral sprite. Loved the season....Loved Misty Day. This scene as all scenes with  Stevie Nicks was epic."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE6bp9YP_rC-4dXfgbRMG-A", "description": ""}
