Just only Emma & Gus.", "When my husband goes out of town for work I used to play Carole King and mope in a fluffy robe the whole time (not Metal.)", "God your kute lol"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "Welcome to American Horror Story Weekly Wednesday Live Stream!
