Way too smart to be on CBS.", "Who the hell disliked this? Was it Samaritan?", "in my opinion, this is one of the best scenes in any tv show", "This is definitely one of the best episodes of the show. Whoever chose this song and made this clip, they did a great job! It just tells you that ''Greer wins'', especially the last 40 seconds.", "\"This was never about winning; this was just about surviving\": this phrase ushers the beginning of the AI dominated era, in a way that reminds me of Terminator 3; General Brewster never sent John and Kate to Crystal Peak to destroy Skynet. There was no such chance. He just wanted them to live and fight another day against the machines.
