Question?? What if they did a theme for either Season 8 or Season 9 titled Apocalypse? I think it would be really cool to be honest & I think Ryan Murphy would do good with that type of story. Don't you agree? & another question for the next two confirmed next seasons 8 & 9 what would you personally pick for the theme? And do you think they'll renew it for a 10th season & petitional be the final season or do you think this show could go on further? Sorry for the long comment lol."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "VIDEO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR SEASON ONE, EPISODE 10 OF AMERICAN HORROR STORY!!!\n\nBeyond the Horror: Murder House, is an unofficial American Horror Story Live After Show.
