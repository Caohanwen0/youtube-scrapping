He punches some dudes, says some vaguely racist shit and roll credits", "I like these kind of movies, clear camera action and just fun.", "At the risk of showing how obsolete I am, I loved the 80\u2019s tv show.

Parker books and watched the Spenser for Hire TV show with Robert Ulrich and Avery Brooks. I could only have fun with it when I told myself this is an alternative universe!
