I just love how passionate you are about the show and you're a massive geek like me :) I'm from the Republic of Ireland and we speak Gaeilge, or native Irish. I'm pretty sure Sc\u00e1thach isn't pronounced like Skath-itch. Sc\u00e1thach in Irish would be pronounced like Skaw-huk. I think so anyways, don't mean to come off like the grammar police lol! It sounds more authentic to the character as well as it sounds more rough and primal, like Sc\u00e1thach herself! :)", "I\u2019m dead, you gave your son the countdown\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nJoin the Freaks of AHS on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheFr...."}
