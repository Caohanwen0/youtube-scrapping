Whatever Reese did in this simulation, he couldn't shoot Lambert, like Shaw couldn't beat Martine at the end of the episode. It's not odd actually, they're two of Greer's most trusted operatives.", "Actually, the actions scenes were better in the first two seasons but this scene is one of greatest scenes of the show, and the actors (Caviezel, Chapman, Ovenden, Emerson) did an excellent job. Thank you for uploading.", "This is my favorite scene from this season! This one and Finch's flashbacks were perfect!", "Clearly, they wanted to take him alive at first but this is JOHN REESE !!!", "Reese is a real bro respect"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjCe8KE9b9WNIw661h9gQnw", "description": "Fight Scene from S04 X 11: If-Then-Else"}
