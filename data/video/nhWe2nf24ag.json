With, ya know, some violence along the way ;)", "It was really nice to see Nathan Ingram again. He's one of the most important characters on the show.", "At least this guy realized what I have after watching so many AI horror movies.  You can't just create an AI, give it wireless access and an objective, and send on its way.  You must teach it the things that we organic beings take for granted.  Morality, compassion, an understanding of the value of life.  Otherwise you're just creating an amalgamation of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao and giving it power beyond that which any single person has ever controlled", "Best AI series. This really gives us an understanding of how AI could be in the future atleast alittle.", "Finch is in red box at 3:57.
