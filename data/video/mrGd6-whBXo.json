I'd say that made him a hero.  Pity he seems to measure his success against those he failed to save.", "Finch is so singularly motivated to save the numbers now that it's hard to imagine a time when he actually shut off the Contingency and revoked Nathan's admin access.", "\"I would tell her... or whoever it was....\"\nWhat's terrifying is that he WAS speaking to the next irrelevant number.  Be careful what you wish for. His wish was granted, and afterwards he regretted what he said when he had to say it to his best friend.", "It's never \"simply\" with you, Harold.", "Nathan Ingram flashbacks are the best. I love this scene too. Two great actors play two great characters. I'm sure Nathan and John also would've made great friends."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPiQaJd58GgMs5k970WE38g", "description": "Person of Interest Zero Day .
