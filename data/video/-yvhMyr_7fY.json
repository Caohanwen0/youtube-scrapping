He was one of those who gains your respect despite being a criminal masterminds.", "This show was the best. The best crime drama, the best procedural drama, the best conspiracy drama, the best sci-fi, the best action thriller, the best buddy cop show, it just excelled at every genre it touched.", "An entire acting class in a 2 minute clip.  Enrico Colantoni shows us how it's done and makes it look easy.  One of the greatest actors working today.", "It really pisses me off that Enrico Colantoni has never won any major awards. Hell he's never even been nominated for anything major.", "\"We are something.............older.\" Wow, what a simple yet elegant line in  a very powerful scene from an episode with lots of great scenes; Carter dying in  John's arms, Fusco bringing in Simmons and getting redemption, and this scene with Elias and Simmons. Great writing meets great acting, not seen too often on tv."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOmJzBC9XO5QXw7PGxBYVgQ", "description": "** CONTAINS SPOILERS **\n\nA very Dark ending from the season 3 episode \"The Devil's Share\""}
