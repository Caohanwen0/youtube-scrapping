This was such a well acted scene and to top it off, it\u2019s accompanied by a wonderfully mournful score.", "I love how he still treated her like a human being flaws and all.", "I cried when she saw her paintings she looked so happy love Sarah Paulson", "I was worried we wouldn\u2019t have anyone to root for in the beginning since the main trio don\u2019t exactly have clear goals yet, but these two, dayum.", "This season is so good so far. The cinematography, writing, acting, and score is top notch. Im lowkey sad we are only getting 6 episodes of this part. I want a whole season of this. There is so much to explore here.
