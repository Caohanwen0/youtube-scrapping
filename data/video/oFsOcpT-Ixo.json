Henson), Finch and Reese are staking out a cop that is going to get killed by HR. In the present, Finch explains who the new number is, a man named Chase Patterson (Zachary Booth). Finch, Root and Fusco are then to work on a case between the two gangs of Elias and Dominic while Reese works on Chase's case regarding the death of Chase's whole family. When Reese asks about the file regarding Chase Patterson, he finds out it was a case of Carter's. As Reese dives into the case, different flashbacks are shown with Carter doing similar investigation to what Reese is doing. As Reese reaches the final destination to the case, he discovers that Chase did not kill his parents and sisters. It was Gil, the doorman at their building, as well as Chase's half-brother.
