That\u2019s what I think triggers Madison to go to the murder house before the world ends. So I think the rest of the season would be the coven fighting to save the world. This would also explain the hourglass in the promos.", "SO PSYCHED ABOUT THIS EVENING, I COULD CRACK IN HALF!!!", "one of my theories  is that a lottery is held to pick winners to visit/stay at Outpost 3 knowing that an Apocalypse is going to happen", "They really should ask you to cameo in  AHS, you'd be an AMAZING  addition to the coven ;) xxx"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nWelcome to American Horror Story Weekly Wednesday Live Stream!
