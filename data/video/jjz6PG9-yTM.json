Because he spent all of his time with the goddess taking care of her, if she was upset about being tied up there she could have touched his head to show him the truth and gotten him to burn down the barn and free her. But since his head was covered, she didn't have anyway to show him.", "The Lead role was one of the best I\u2019ve seen in years.", "Since they are located in nothern England, on an island not identified, most probably the symbol resembles to the celtic sign of infinity, which confirms that the goddess is indeed, Gaia. Mother Earth. A representation of earth as a mother of all life in it. As she refuses to eat or drink from her own children, animals, she ends up succumbing to the desire for flesh and blood. Just like humans did when they tasted meat and drank animal blood for strength rituals.  ", "I believe Malcom's smile at the end was that of peace and letting go. I think he knew everything can be ok even though it wasn't how he wanted it. Remember, it was Quinn in the first place who started the whole feeding her blood and flesh. Not that Malcom isn't a villain, but Michael Sheen is a great actor and I think he was totally giving us a peaceful smile."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "I take a deep dive into Netflix's \"Apostle\" to decipher its ambiguous ending and check out some of the details you missed.\n\nFor updates check out my twitter: www.twitter.com/thinkstoryyt\n\nHelp me translate this video: "}
