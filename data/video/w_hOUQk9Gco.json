This is the best tribute for this an amazing show! You've done such a beautiful work here. Thank you so much for this masterpiece!", "I always knew that John was not going to have a happily ever after. The very thing that made him a primary asset was the same thing that disqualified him from a normal life. He went into the forge and came out a weapon. A weapon's only purpose is to fight, or break under use not rust away somewhere. To have lived at all is the miracle. To have helped others is a gift to the future. To be remembered at all is the highest praise. To have a meaningful, useful death is the greatest reward. That is the way of things when one is a weapon.", "Currently rewatching the entirety of POI for the first time since Season 5 ended, currently on episode 1 of Season 3. \n\n7 years since it started and I still believe POI is one of, if not the greatest show ever made. Amazing storylines, acting and characters (who were superbly cast) this show had it all, even a great ending which I think is rare for most shows.
