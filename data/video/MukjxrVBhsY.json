It was suspenseful, but nothing developed enough to be solidified within the timeframe of the movie. Literally, everything we learned about the villain of the story came from a character that was untrustworthy due to shady behavior from not wanting to be poor, just to have him die minutes later. I finished the movie thinking, what was the truth? How did all these characters intertwine, why were there no flashbacks with the old man and the gardener, and how did the gardener actually die?  Also, were the documents false? Did Katie live up to her good samaritan persona and tell the truth about the will? and if so, if or not, how is she still living in the house? It felt rushed, could have been a mini series that provided more details."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "Netflix's latest original thriller \"Dangerous Lies\" offers a predictable plot riddled with holes.
