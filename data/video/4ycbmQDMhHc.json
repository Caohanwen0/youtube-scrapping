The ending showed us that the fight continues even tho Kandar is dead.  Book of the Dead contains the names of many demons who are supposedly still alive.  If they're still alive then the KOS has the obligation to hunt them down and kill them.  Even tho Ashe's destiny has been fulfilled he is The King as hailed by the KOS and he has their privilege.  They have a job for him which will be described by the woman at the end of the season finale."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "#STARZ always uploads the episode at 12am on Sunday mornings so this stream is to get hyped for the final episode of #AshvsEvilDead series.
