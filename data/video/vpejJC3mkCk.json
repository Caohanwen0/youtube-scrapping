She is in a class by herself, and no one else even comes close.    Not only is she drop dead gorgeous, she is so sweet, charming, down to Earth, grounded,  lovely, and all about her family.  I still often wonder if she is really human because she is just too perfect!!", "*prays it's a premier for a Shoot spin off*"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ1zyiCmd3QBRTDw5AoDpgw", "description": ""}
