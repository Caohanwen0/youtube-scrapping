The threat becomes neutralized, but an inner-governmental privacy-activist group with a mole in the U.S.S.S. has turned the full force of the Secret Service on Reese and Shaw. The Machine has secretly enlisted Logan Pierce, Joey Durban and Harper Rose to secure a clever exit strategy, with each of whom camouflaging into various resourceful associations; when Reese and Fusco are extracted, they band together with Logan, Joey and Harper to discuss their enlistment by the Machine, what has happened and what is to come. Harold, meanwhile, is grieving over the loss of Root, and reaches a conclusion that brings him to a highly-secured government facility in San Antonio, Texas with a weaponized virus capable of destroying Samaritan but with significant collateral damage. Harold has become ready to go to any lengths, and Reese and Shaw prepare for their final battle.\n\nJune 7, 2016"}
