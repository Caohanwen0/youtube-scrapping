Did the Battle of Winterfell live up to the hype?

He tells Theon he\u2019s home and winterfell has always been his home.", "Eddison: Stay back he's got blue eyes! \nTormund: I've always had blue eyes! \n\nI fckn love tormund and I'm so glad that he made it.... So far anyways \ud83d\ude0b", "While I do feel that the Night King's death felt  gratuitous and rushed, I applaud the enite GoT production team for that amazing piece of television history.  I read that it took the cast 55 nights just to film this battle episode. I am going to savor and enjoy these last few episodes trying hard not to be critical.  I have been a fan since the series premiered and it has been a part of many seasons of my life. When it's all said and done, I will truly miss Game of Thrones and the joy it has brought me. Thank you George R.R. Martin, HBO and everyone that has made this wonderful show possible. \u2764"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "We break down season 8 episode 3 \"The Long Night\" aka. \"The Battle of Winterfell\" of HBO's hit fantasy series \"Game of Thrones\", exploring its ending and recapping some of the hidden details you may have missed along the way.\n\nFollow me on twitter: "}
