I\u2019m so sad for Papi", "\"If we didn't get a season 2 I'd probably fucking riot\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Yesssss!", "I know you were upset that Elecktra started working at the peep show. But at that time. It really was what was going on at that time in the community i have many friends that had to do crazy and rediculous things to keep a float in that time. So it was true to that era. But im happy to say that those same people are now actors and make up artist and desiners and got out of that life and made something of themselves. Actually half of the people you see on pose had to do what they had to do. And now they are in POSE in one way or another. Extras ect.....", "That's true, I couldn't feel any sympathy for Poppy (sp?) cos his character seems 2D and not fleshed out yet. \n\nAnyway I felt bad for Electra because ever since her penis removal she's getting disrespect on every side--her lover ejects her from his life, another man rejects her, she is replaced by another woman who is now with her ex lover, her \"kids\" turn on her, cos there's no money coming anymore from her ex...all because she wanted to be a real woman. I don't blame her for being so vitriolic in this episode."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nMARY'S BOOKS & THANGS:\n--website: www.maryannmoody.us\n--Patreon: "}
