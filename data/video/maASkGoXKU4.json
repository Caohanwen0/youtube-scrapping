And its not IMPOSSIBLE.", "I just love how paternal John is with Leila and I love how her hands are so small compared to John's huge hands, well after all she is a baby but still its so cute. And I loved it when Leila's hand was on his shoulder, barely gripping it because her hand was so small. I also loved it when John kept on saying \"Cry'' because he's like so soft spoken and that little kiss he gave her.... so adorable.
