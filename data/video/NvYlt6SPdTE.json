You caught a few things that I didn't. I've seen a few people point out the fact that the car CG climbs on is red, perhaps signifying the bodies of the dead.\n\nOnce interesting element that you don't touch on that I thin is interesting is the \"fake gun\" that scares everyone away. I think it reinforces the theme of \"paying attention to the wrong thing.\" Nobody seems to care when Gambino really kills people, but they all run away when he holds up a fake gun.", "When he's not dancing.. when he's not killing... he's running for his life...", "The video was very interesting overall and had some deep, dark undertones of society. The message to me personally is that as a society dances around issue of violence, suicide, rioting, Black murders and etc. People just focus on the fun and not on reality. This used to be a conspiracy theory that the tv was made to cause people to ignore real world issues and situations. Everyone in the front is having fun with Childish Gambino while the pale horse of death is looming around us circling earth. Very thought provoking video.", "I think the video was absolutely brilliant and thought provoking. Your analysis was great!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "A quick analysis looking at some of the hidden meaning and symbolism found in Childish Gambino's \"This is America.\"\n\nSubscribe and follow me at: "}
