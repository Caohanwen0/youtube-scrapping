I hope that there are different vehicles throughout the map; some are complete, some have only a few items missing, and some need everything in order to drive it.  I think it would really add to the immersion by doing it that way.  I also hope they put spot lights on either driver or front passenger sides of the vehicle.  That would look awesome on a foggy, creepy night; looking like a ghostly lighthouse beacon.", "I really hope that eventually they will add some new vehicle types, ie vans, trucks, etc.I am Really looking forward to seeing what else they can do in scum.", "that will be great! I'm loving this game so far. ( playing single player at the moment ) to be able to tow vehicles would be great \ud83d\ude04", "this went beyond my expectations, this is the most extensive vehicle upgrade i saw in any game. Devs are working hard to provide an excellent game experience, yet the game imo needs to lean more to military realism, its good where it is now but i wish for the game to surpass Dayz so we will have another competitor in this genre.", "This is exciting but I feel like they need to address the desyncing of moving vehicles before allowing players to drive around the map mowing everyone down with a mounted machine gun while on everyone else's server they are teleporting across the place with you unable to do anything because you already have perfect ping with the server"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyVZJAZ4sPg4wxmsqscVAmQ", "description": "Today I am back in Scum with the news.\n\nLast Scum Video: https://youtu.be/XapZbS-K7rI"}
