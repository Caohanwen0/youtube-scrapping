Using his power means showing superiority, as you stated. It would've seemed dismissive. So actually HANDING Pyro back his lighter shows equality, furthering the point of \"you are like me, you are better than them, come with me if you want to give your life/power meaning\"", "still one of the best comic book movie to this day", "Screen crush: \u201cmagneto is ISIS\u201d\n\n\nAlso screen crush: \u201cmagneto is Hagrid\u201d", "One of my favorite villainous scenes HAS to be Vulture confronting Spiderman (Homecoming) on the way to driving his daughter to prom. Spiderman has his strength, agility, senses and reflexes even without the suit. Vulture just has a pistol and his attitude...and he fully intimidates a hero that could literally rip him in two.
