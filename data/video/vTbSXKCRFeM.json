And I cannot believe this question hasn't been asked, but I haven't seen it in any video interview with her, but HOW DOES THE MACHINE COMMUNICATE WITH ROOT?   I mean, what was the inception, how did she even know the machine existed, and why would the machine talk to her?", "For about 9 years now i have been designing a game based off a story I'm writing called :THE TRIALS OF NARCON. Up until recently i have shied away from this project due to personal reasons', however, Amy you single handily revitalized my passion to continue to explore and expand my ideas for the story. Thank you so much for inspiring me to continue on my journey it means a lot. #root"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ1zyiCmd3QBRTDw5AoDpgw", "description": ""}
