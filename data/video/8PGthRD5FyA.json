Tessah goes into a deep discussion about what it looks like to seek out your purpose even when you are overwhelmed by a busy college schedule. We often spend so much time asking God \"what is my purpose in this season\" but we don't prioritize him in our lives. In this episode, you will learn how to find your identity in Jesus and narrow down what purpose God might just have for you while you are in college. Tessah also talks about what it looks like to pursue your calling in college and the best way to narrow down what you were created to do! God has a BIG plan for you, even in college."}
