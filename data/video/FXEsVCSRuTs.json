I keep seeing people's theory that Michael is not a warlock, but there is room for him to be both a warlock and the anti-Christ. It has not been shown to be mutually exclusive until we know for sure who or what Mallory is. I wonder if Ms. Meade's soul is inside the robot which is why she remembers Michael vaguely, but her memories are overridden by the programmed memories within her hard drive.", "Ugh ALIENS that's her entire theory... I just saved you 9 mins", "I'm scared because of the next episode... what if Michael kills all of the witches? Also, I WANT TO SEE VENEABLE AGAIN!!!", "He could take people out of hell.why didn't he use his power to bring her back? Why make a robot ? This is really weird\u2026, I don't think the last 3ep could tell us all .anyway. I LOVE UR THEORY"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nmondaysRmurder channel link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHmt..."}
