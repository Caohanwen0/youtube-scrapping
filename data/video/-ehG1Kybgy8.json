Oh my goodness. I'd already thought about how hard it must have been for Crowley to put Aziraphale's body into flame, but I hadn't noticed the parallel with Aziraphale's fear of Crowley being destroyed by holy water: that even though they both have some fun with their trials (especially Aziraphale) they are also both having to face and overcome their worst fear about what could happen to the other. Beautifully done!", "\"Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for (six) thousand years\"", "IT FITS THEIR CHARACTERS SO WELL ;-;", "This is amazing. I don't have the words to say how beautiful it is. Thanks for this video <3", "This is so beautifully and thoughtfully edited -- everything fits them so well, and your clip choices are so perfect.  I love the way you so carefully told the story of their relationship to match the words, and I love the way you circle back to the wall of Eden -- it's absolutely brilliant and wonderful and I can't watch it often enough.  THANK YOU."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjYo4fJ0Mj1-Cik5v2mIv1Q", "description": "Back at it again with another overused song that just *fits* though - I mean, is it my fault that they have, in fact, loved each other for a thousand years and *will* love each other for a thousand more? ^^\n\nAlso I can't believe that I haven't made a full video in close to 2 years, yet those two nerds just made very quick work of dragging me out of retirement... But I'm here for frame-by-frame work on any and all Ineffable Husbands scenes; watching Michael Sheen's face work is a reward in itself xD\n\nClips: Good Omens\nSong: \"A Thousand Years\" by Christina Perri"}
