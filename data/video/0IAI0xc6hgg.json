How can someone know all this music, know exactly where it fits, and get the job of deciding that? That person is a champion, a demigod of style."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkOQfPHKjU0lQnVpVuqfeew", "description": "Sorry for the delay but here it is. I put together my favourite scenes from Season 1 POI. Its just the scenes themselves there is no music over the top. I tried to tell it like a story (kind of), so every character gets showen once at the beginning, and then whatever there next big scene was I showed it next. The scenes are in order of episodes (I think). I tried to give all characters screen time but there is no doubting there is more Reese than anybody else. Sorry its so long, there is too many great scenes I didnt know what to leave out. Nothing fancy about this video, but its something. Hope you like it. :)"}
