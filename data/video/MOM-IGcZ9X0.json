Still as much as I love this show the ghost rules are kind of ridiculous, they can make themselves be seen and solid and can kill, and also be supermodels according to Hotel lol, at anytime yet so much of the world doesnt believe in ghosts. Sure maybe alot of them want to hide,but these characters dont give a fuck about possible discovery. It seems like they would have been discovered by someone, but its horror so I'm not really looking fur realism lol Anyway I thought Emma's acting was excellent this episode especially right before her execution when she spoke to Margaret and made that bitch recoil in fear!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "The new season of American Horror Story: 1984 is here and we're going to breakdown episode 6 \"Episode 100\" reviewing theories, details you missed, and what it could mean for the rest of the season.\n\nFollow me on twitter: www.twitter.com/thinkstoryYT\n\nHelp me translate this video: "}
