I'm sorry to hear that. \nWhen John turned around and whistled for Bear (then \"Butcher,\") I was so excited. I'm so glad they added him to the show. If it's appropriate and it's done right, adding a dog to a story can serve to humanize the characters (ie, John may be a tough badass, but he loves his doggo just like I do.) I love how they wrote Bear into the show as a character instead of the usual mentioning that the main character has a dog and then never showing the dog again that I've seen in many TV shows. Bear helped balance the intensity of the show with some humor, and just overall was a nice touch to the show. His scenes always made me smile. ", "Wow.  I loved that dog and I'm so saddened to just now find out he passed away.  Deepest condolences to his owner, trainer and all who loved him.  He was an amazing dog. Be at peace, Boker!", "I loved the addition of Bear, so sad to hear that he passed away. Rember thinking while watching the Elias is alive reveal, that whoever tries to hurt Bear would be the biggest idiot. His alias are two ex-spies, two badass hackers, and one of them has a direct connection to an ASI,  a cop, and last but not least a ruthless mobster.", "Rip him.
