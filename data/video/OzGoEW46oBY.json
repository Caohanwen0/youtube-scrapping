It's so psychologically disturbing and creative with amazing characters and a nice vibe, beautiful location, amazing music, interesting storyline and an incredible ending. The ending is probably one of my favourite moments from the season; dare I say my favourite season finale. Beautifully done. I cried multiple times this season and it's the type of season I could rewatch a dozen times and not get tired of. It's my favourite season too, with Asylum coming in at second place; but out of all of them, this one holds a special place in my heart.", "My mom: Don\u2019t watch that it\u2019s too scary\nAHS: tHe NaMe gAMe", "Ryan Murphy really said \"AHS but make it Glee\"", "\"You don't own me\" by sister Mary Eunice is the real bomb.", "The name game was one of my favorite parts of asylum"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz3AEWoElzaJsVes_qk8UiQ", "description": "1.
