THIS VIDEO IS AMAZING! I have playlist on my phone with songs from your videos and this song now will be on top of it!\nSo much feelings right now. I can't stand Root's pain I wanna hug her so tight right now :'C but our lovely Shaw is alive and it's all that matters! Great video! Oh I just can't understand why some people are so hatefull for love between two womens or mans it's so sad :c. Today I has long conversation like 3 hour talking about gays with two girls who came to me from some church and they don't understand it. They don't even know about it much it's so sad but I turn on my laptop and see your video and I am so happy it really help me in situations like that. SHOOT IS AMAZING! DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PEOPLE THINK. Thank you for videos. Now I'm gonna watch episode 14 if it is on internet in Poland :). Good job!
