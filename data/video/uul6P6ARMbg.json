With this, because we really don't know much about the ocean in general, the idea that alien-like creatures dwell in the deep sea could go hand and hand with the beach clues that Ryan Murphy has been dropping. Also, as Ryan said, a huge clue is revealed in episode 8 of AHS 1984. Right in the beginning of the episode, the reporter mentions both aliens and the Loch Ness Monster. Could the legend of the Loch Ness Monster be incorporated into the ideas of aliens? The hitchhiker in this episode also tells jingles about the feeling of being lonely like drifting in space forever. I'm definitely aware that i've been pressing the alien theme for every season following season 2 lol, but the beach hints to me suggest that the entire season won't be about the beach, but rather what lurks in the ocean or how aliens can use our oceans as sort of \"landing docks\" for their UFOs (whatever that means). Again, the Loch Ness Monster may be incorporated which could relate to aliens of some sort.", "I need to figure out what this season is"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH_TWswNlSRz9LtnpWOmA2Q", "description": "#AmericanHorrorStory #AHS #Horror\n\nThings are beginning to wash up on shore\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since American Horror Story: 1984 ended and we\u2019re thirsty for season 10.
