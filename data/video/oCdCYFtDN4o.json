Thanks everyone who has watched along the way. Make sure to leave a comment on your thoughts and theories below :)", "Pass Pawn is actually an official term in chess. It means something totally different from what you are talking about. A passed Pawn is when your Pawn has no other pieces in its file that might prevent it from advancing all the way  across the board, where it  can be promoted, and turned into whatever piece you want, typically a queen, the most powerful piece on the board.

Dolores essentially has taking control of the board and turned Caleb into something that more suitably matches his potential.
