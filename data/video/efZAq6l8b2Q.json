When he first introduced under the guise of a \"Mini\", I felt like... This guy's got some authenticity to him. Seems a waste of an actor like this on a minion that's probably going to die this episode. So when he was revealed to be Dominic, I kind of expected it - or at least, that there'd be more to him than first revealed. He makes a pretty believable villain.", "\"A man is not a river, and you are not a king.\", marvellous line. So happy Winston Duke is becoming a big star", "even the 'bad guys' in Person of Interest were likable.", "This is such a brilliantly written and performed scene. Hard to believe Winston Duke was so inexperienced at this time, his lines delivered with such skill", "Based on how intelligent and intimidating Winston Duke carries himself in this series, he will NAIL the role of M'Baku/Man-Ape in \"Black Panther\""], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNXArzaLjkNaAd-afGgo1aA", "description": "Season 4, Episode 6\n\n\"A man is not a river, and you are not a king.\""}
