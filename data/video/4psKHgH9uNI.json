My favourite song and show! You are a genius :-)", "This is too perfect, im almost surprised this is not a fan song", "How can you turn such a funny song into such a perfect song for these two????", "i love this video! the song fits surprisingly well and i love that it's so upbeat-- just like them (usually)!!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvh0jJE0Ut_d2IieR0ANLsA", "description": "One Week by Barenaked Ladies\nClips from Good Omens\nI own nothing.\n______________\nThis was supposed to become a more humorous edit than it ended up being - I realised about halfway through that I couldn't make it into the thing I originally wanted it to be (one of those videos highlighting lots of the funny quotes of the show) because the song worked too well for that. It's still upbeat enough for my liking, though. I'll still try to make that other kind of edit at some point. Enjoy this one in the meantime!"}
