Never have I seen a more brilliant, deserving performance go COMPLETELY unrecognized by the Emmys. Most people think of Michael as an actor who is \"good at playing villains.\" But I don't think there was any actor on television at this time who played the good guy better than Michael Emerson played Harold Finch. His performance was compassionate, wise, vulnerable, intense, powerful, charming, chilling and mesmerizing. No one else could have done it better.", "How POI and its cast dont win major awards is beyond me. GOAT show.", "\"I'm going to kill you\" So badass ; even Reese would be afraid of him.", "Ever since Samaritan was introduced, we've seen Finch and the Machine lose battle after battle because they've always been fighting with one hand tied behind their back. Now we're finally going to see Finch use the full extent of his capabilities to fight back."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrt8WtZwxBVXDQbNYRcwg1Q", "description": ""}
