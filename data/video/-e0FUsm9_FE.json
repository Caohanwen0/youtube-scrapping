I left the FB group awhile back so I wasn\u2019t sure how to get ahold of you lol", "I believe revealing the theme now was a smart move, the hype is gonna be higher and higher with the new updates on the cast and the storyline. I had ideas in mind that Emma maybe will be the final girl, Cody one of the slashers or the main one if they follow the campy 80s slash route!  Hope this season we can see Darren and Finn too with the past teaser Ryan gave us with their photo together.", "I think Sarah Paulson is gonna be a mother trying to find her child after sending them to a camp", "I honestly think this season might be about Texas chainsaw because when the girl was running she had boots on and us Texans wear  boots ( some of us. Not me) and the killer had overalls on"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "The theme has been freed!! #AHS1984\n\n\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r..."}
