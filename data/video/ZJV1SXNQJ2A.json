I wanted to hug him. I like his character and I hope he is in every episode", "I surprisingly enjoy Leslie this season. Ursula is gonna get all her ways for sure, so not worried about her ...", "Plot twist, Ryan Murphy took the pill to write this season and that\u2019s why it\u2019s good", "This episode made me uncomfortable, and that\u2019s what true horror is to me. This was definitely one of the best AHS episodes in a VERY long time. Stories isn\u2019t even at the level of this new season of AHS.
