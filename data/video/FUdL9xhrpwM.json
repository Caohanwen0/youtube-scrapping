I personally cried MULTIPLE TIMES and was overjoyed to see an Emma Roberts character survive.", "I was sobbing at this, I mean it was a happy ending but....SPOILERS AHEAD!", "\"Every generation, blames the one before!\"", "It was one of the best endings. I didn't watched this episode and till this day and it was worth it the whole episode was awesome Brooke and Donna alive. I knew Ryan won't disappoint us and he did not. Basically I happy and satisfied ( spacially what they did to Margaret it was more then satisfying it was awesome and she deserves it but of course she didn't dead off the camp as they thought) how season ended with Brooke having two beautiful children and husband and Donna well, she helps people, and last but not least as I thought Ben and his mother and Bobby now in peace knowing that Bobby is safe from now on. It was awesome season I don't care if someone says otherwise I think it was one of the best seasons. Specially I think it was the best season which was Emma Roberts was in I mean Brooke was good then she was bitch  kind but at the end she was the person she came to camp Redwood good and innocent."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwVpopzHmJWh63-urzqGruQ", "description": "Show- American Horror Story season 9"}
