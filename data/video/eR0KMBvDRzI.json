What if the white and black scorpions from the first trailer represented the twins from the first season. The black one represents the anti Christ and the white one represented the twin that died. Maybe in season 8 the coven has to get to the dead twin or use him somehow and maybe he is the key to stopping the anti Christ. Maybe that's why the white one was red this time in the third teaser, it could represent that he is now dead.", "If Moira could \"Grow Up\" in a sense after she died in the Murder House maybe Vivien's other twin will age but only so that it's visible to the other ghosts or maybe only to the living.", "Mary! I was rewatching coven a while ago and Misty day, when faced with the idea that she might die in the process of trying to become the Supreme, said she had already made arrangements for how she was going to bring herself back. So I think she's already got something ready to go. Being in hell is not going to matter. She will come back!", "Kidney Stones?? Oh Mary, I'm sorry to hear that.  Drink lots of water with lemon.  Get well soon sweetheart. God Bless!\u2764\ufe0f", "Hope you feel better Mary! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nCover Image by Danny Vera.
