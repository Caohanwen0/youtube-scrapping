Its AWESOME!", "Could the four-foot cherubs (described in your video)  correspond to the story lines of Harvey (temperance), Michaela (purity), Cal (healing) and Ben (peace)?] In episode one Harvey asked for a drink, Michaela said to Isaiah she was not pure, Cal has leukemia, and Ben has marital problems with Grace and difficulties with Olive. Probably a bit too simplistic or contrived. Just a thought.", "Thanks for the information (or perhaps I should say \"refresher\") on the Biblical account of the Pool of Bethesda in John's Gospel concerning the healing of the paralytic.  Interesting that they actually created a symbolic homage to the story through the Bethesda fountain commemorating the New York aqueduct.", "starting this show today. i will be back when im caught up", "\u201cMy ex-wife\u201d took me outta there \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34Qdd5Z5KN30A8aJ2eIMPA", "description": "Theories, easter eggs, and details you missed all explained for episode four \"Unclaimed Baggage\" of NBC's new show, \"Manifest.\"\n\nFollow me on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ThinkStoryYT\n\nHelp me translate this video here: "}
