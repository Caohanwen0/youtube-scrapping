Hey, if Mallory has the spirit of an angel... and Langdon thought he killed them all, does that mean he killed the angel of death from season 2? Please no :(", "The theory my boyfriend and I came up with is that Mallory is a fallen angel/angel of some sort because she scared the freaking Antichrist! Has to be!", "I just think Mallory is very powerful witch, and if Cordelia dies, could be the next supreme. When she says something is inside her, its a metaphor for her powers. I think she unconsciously knew she was a witch, but never put two and two together. I hope we get a good back story for Mallory, she's shaping up to be the best character, along side Michael, this season."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nImages by Danny Vera.
