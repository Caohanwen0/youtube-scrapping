But I'm hoping to cover the finale next week!", "Fett looked like a Twilak Pimp in that new matte paint job. And I was thoroughly impressed with Bill Burr\u2019s dramatic acting. The way his facial expressions changed while reliving the events on Burnin Kohn until he finally snapped and killed Hess is a testament to his acting chops. I\u2019ve always loved his viper like in your face style of stand-up, and I hope he parlays this into more dramatic stuff. Also, his line after shooting the refinery \u201cSome of us need to sleep at night!\u201d Was the best line in the episode and spoke so much about his character without not having to actually say much. Damn good storytelling. My only gripe is these episodes are too damn Short! If we can\u2019t binge watch these all at once the day the season starts they need to be longer. Thanks for the video, TS. Looking forward to the next one.", "Given how everything is tying together, I think the Jedi that shows up for Grogu will be Ezra Bridger.", "I'm glad you still taken the time for us ...\ud83d\ude04\u261d\ud83c\udffe\u261d\ud83c\udffe\u261d\ud83c\udffe you still one of the best breaking shit down....", "When did Bill Burr turn into Marlon fkin Brando?
