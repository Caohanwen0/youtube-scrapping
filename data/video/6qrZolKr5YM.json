I also have a theory. Remember at the end of coven when the new witches were coming in and Zoey asked Cordelia \" how are we gonna house all of these girls?\" And Cordelia said \"we'll buy more houses if we have to.\" Well what if the murder house is the second house that the academy buys to hold the new witches?? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14  #ThinkAboutThat", "This is the most wonderful time of the year when your posting about AHS 2-4 times a week!", "Hoping Queenie and Misty manage to come back \ud83d\udc80", "My theory is the witches will go to LA to investigate the disappearance of Queenie and come across the murder house somehow", "Honestly I just wish that the New Orleans Coven don't get all killed off, basically because I just love it - mostly for the amazing house."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheFr..."}
