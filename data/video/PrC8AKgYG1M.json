The virus had just infected the machine and its all glitched out. Its spooky and I love it"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLHXgL0fYJ6XIr5J4SUgsnA", "description": "ALL OF THEM*\nok, this time I present to you all* the variations of Person Of Interest intros.\nPerson of Interest opening intros from all seasons. As a bonus I added version with Root and one another with disturbance.\nIf you think I added something twice - I didn't. After Joss death they cut her out from the intro, so that make 2 slightly different intros, same goes with season 1 and 5 - when Fusco finally learned about The Machine, he turnes yellow :)))\n\nSo here is the list:\nSeason 1 - normal\nSeason 1 - with Fusco\nSeason 2 - normal\nSeason 3 - normal\nSeason 3 - without Joss :( different placing for characters\nSeason 3 - interference with Root's voice\nSeason 4 - normal\nSeason 4 - interference with Control's voice\nSeason 5 - normal\nSeason 5 - Fisco box turned yellow :)\n\n* as Rex Lii pointed out, I didn't put the 2x21 begining, because in my opinion it wasn't an intro, just a short indication of it and it was brutally cut short because of the virus and The Shit That About To Go Down"}
