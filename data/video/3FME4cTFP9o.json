I\u2019m super excited for this plot and how it plays out and how it will connect to the Death Valley plot", "The aliens do not come into play until Part 2! That was the point of getting two separate stories. One is Is BY THE SEA, and one ON THE SAND quoted by Ryan Murphy himself. Aliens are Part 2 on the sand", "First 5 episodes are Red tide story and last 5 episodes are another story with the Aliens. Im already liking this more than 1984 season. Side note Billie Lourd is a Babe \ud83e\udd75", "Me watching the episodes; \u201cYou\u2019re had two years to polish this turd, it better be perfect\u201d", "I'm finishing up part 2 right now.  I LOVE this one so far!  It's SO much better than 1984.. which I never finished because I didn't like the storyline.  (Maybe I'll go back some day to it).  I didn't recognize Sarah Paulson at first and Macaulay Culkin is a welcome addition and fantastic!  I get wait to see if the Alien part is completely separate or if it is intertwined with Red Tide.  :)"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmqVC3JUzamSwfdn441JuBg", "description": "In our American Horror Story: Double Feature premiere and episode 2 review and recap we talk zombie-vampires, the writing process, and all sorts of cool/scary stuff.\n\nAMERICAN HORROR STORIES FINALE REVIEW: RETURN TO MURDER HOUSE"}
