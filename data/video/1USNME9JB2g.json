The Antichrist had been on Earth for fifteen hours, and one angel and one demon had been drinking solidly for three of them.\"\n\n...In reality it is, in fact, nearer 10am and PeggyCosplays and Halusional have just drank IronBru for the first time (along with several other assorted colourful energy drinks) and have definitely convinced every innocent passer-by that they are absolutely smashed in the middle of a public park before lunch time.\n\nAnthony J. Crowley: Halusional\nAziraphale: PeggyCosplays\n\nMusic is 'Liquid Lunch' by Caro Emerald.\n\nGood Omens is written by Sir Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, and this is our adaption of their spectacular creation.\n\nFind our cosplay group, HedleyKowCosplay, and our individual profiles on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr for more content like this, as well as behind the scenes photos and footage!"}
