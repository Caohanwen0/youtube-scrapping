I like that rob zombie didnt just make what we've seen before, which I feel a lot of people felt the opposite.\n\nEdit:", "I personally enjoy both these films in no way are they the best remakes but still fun to watch at least they're way better than the friday the 13th remake", "I\u2019d like to know why I was removed from the freaks of AHS group when I always followed the rules and even reported spoilers so it would not be ruined for anyone else in the group,I feel discriminated against, I\u2019ve made lots of friends I can talk to about AHS and now I\u2019m getting denied that for no apparent reason, is there a way I can be added back into the group I\u2019m sad and confused AND it\u2019s Wednesday:(", "I agree with you on everything.   I have one to add.  I didn't like that Mike killed the guide who actually treated Mike as a person.  Danny T.
