Both Reese and Finch are trying to find a way to fix it before the virus infects the Machine. Special Counsel also figures that there is a threat to the machine. Root, who is now Special Counsel's personal assistant, interrogates him regarding the machine. Meanwhile Finch gets a number from a payphone. The number belongs to Ernest Thornhill a CEO of a data entry company who is buying several payphone companies in New York. Decima Technologies, Finch, Root, Shaw and Reese all try to get to Thornhill but later Finch figures out that Thornhill is a fake identity created by the machine as kind of a survival instinct by the machine. Finch figures out which payphone the Machine is going to call so he and Root go the New York Public Library later followed by Shaw and Reese, where they encounter Greer's men who are guarding the payphones. When midnight strikes and the call comes, Root answers the phone but Finch routes the call to a payphone near Reese so he too can answer the phone.\n\nMay 2, 2013\n\n+122"}
