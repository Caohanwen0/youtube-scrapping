What's the the difference between a power and spell? Mallory's unique power is called Tempus Infinitum, but it's not really a power, it's a spell, but then again it's called a power by Myrtle. Same with Decensum, it's a power, but it's used through a spell. Also, Myrtle used Concilium on Baldwin and Ariel without using a spell, but uses a spell to control the minds of Venable, Jeff, and Mutt. Maybe the terminology of Power and Spell are the same in some way, idk?", "Love it", "Yay! I've been waiting and checking for this video!
