After critical and commercial success, it has since released nine seasons and grown a cult following. Roughly ten years ago, when Instagram was only used by a handful of hipsters and Charlie Sheen was still \u2018winning\u2019, every angsty teenager was obsessed with AHS. Tumblr was full of heavily edited images taken from the show and fans discussed episodes on forums and blogs. On its ten year anniversary, I finally watched Murder House for the first time. But is it still as good after a decade? I\u2019ll discuss the season, its themes and place in pop culture history in this video essay retrospective. Warning: major spoilers ahead.\n\nThis is my first video essay, and naturally I still have a lot to learn. If you have suggestions, tips or want to share your opinions on Murder House, please leave a comment. If like this retrospective, please subscribe! Thanks for watching.\n \nMusic by the talented Kevin MacLeod: "}
