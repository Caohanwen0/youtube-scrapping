Happy International Women\u2019s Day!!! \ud83d\ude0a", "You are so true! I really really miss Obama, though I'm Canadian. Since the second grade I used to hang with the boys all the way up to the present. I noticed in the early 2000. I have attempted to make girl friends. But it always goes wrong. I would have their backs, been supportive, was very caring without overgoing it. This is up to three years ago. I've had a \"friend\" who stabbed me in the back, or ignore, or competed with me, or telling lies...now this take a me back to second grade when my so called friend did to me all the the things these other girl friends have done to me. Except for this same girl from grade 2 was very manipulative. I don't trust girls. The last three years I have up on female friends and accepted that I'd rather hang out with guys. Guys don't bitch with other guys like girls do. Now I hold girls at arm's length but I'm no longer bitter about girl friends. I'm just happier with guy friends, just one of the guys. That's makes me happy, and at peace. I can finally sigh peacefully."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "Happy International Women's Day 2019!\n\n#InternationalWomensDay #2019"}
