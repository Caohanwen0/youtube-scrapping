It would also explain more as to why Fiona was so upset and envious of Madison. Not only does Madison remind Fiona of her lost youth and beauty but also the fact she\u2019s a famous celebrity reminds her of Constance and her lost dreams as well.", "God, I really hope that Jessica is coming back. AHS hasn't been the same without her and since it's a crossover of 2 seasons with Jessica it would only make sense for her to return. \u2665\ufe0f Love the theory videos", "Addie had the same power.  She KNEW that people\u2019s (twins, Vivian) fate.  \u201cYou\u2019re going to die here.\u201d", "The only reason why Constance recommends building a gazebo is because she wants Moira stuck there forever"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": "\u25ba \u25ba SUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5r...\n\nCover Image by Danny Vera.
