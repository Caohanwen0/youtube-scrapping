He clearly loved her.", "One of the best acted scenes ever. The phone ringing trying to warn Finch that John or Det. Carter were about to be killed. Showing John being with her at the time of her death. The look of just pure shock on Finch's face. Just left a lump in my throat...", "Caviezel is so damn brilliant. I love how John at first looks away and tries to hold his tears, but he can't and breaks down finally. Fantastic acting.", "I felt so bad for carter after Cal's death because I think she felt guilty for not believing him that she got totally obsessed to the point of her own death. She finally brought in finch and reese but it was too late. The death was very sad, but very realistic. Good job on the writers for a beautiful written and well acted episode.", "The ringing phone gives chills"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJGgbrPkH-VlLsEZPkmycLg", "description": "I don't bring a happy scene to my subscribers - I bring Carter's death...
