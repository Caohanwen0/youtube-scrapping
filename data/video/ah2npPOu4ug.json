Do you think it'll be under the murder house?", "My theory about Cordelia being eaten by zombies is that that happens at the end of episode 4, then the twist in episode 5 is that it turns out it was just a vision she had and up until that point, they believed Michael to be on their side. However, Cordelia saw that he becomes supreme and is the cause of the apocalypse, so she convinced everyone this then they go to New Orleans to resurrect the dead witches to help take Michael down. Then set up a sort of base camp at the murder house in L.A where they become allies with the ghosts there and resurrect them to help fight, and then all of them try to kill Michael and end the apocalypse.", "The snakes are a witch reference. Coven had snakes in the title sequence \ud83d\udda4", "I was thinking- just like the witches accidentally releasing the Axe-man by accident, What if Madison or the Anti-Christ released the rubber man/ Tate from the murder house? Idk it kinda makes sense."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5rwO1EcnOo6ydOmGItlGQ", "description": ""}
