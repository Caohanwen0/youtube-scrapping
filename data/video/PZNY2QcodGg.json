Part cat... Should be taken into consideration, because... Well... Cats can see in the dark. It means that in the dark she's finally able to see what really matters to her, to see beyond her \"darkness\", her anger, her guilt...", "This series has better writing (symbolism/plot/dialogue) than 90%+ of anything else on Netflix or cable these days.  Don\u2019t even get me started on animation, art style, character and sound design, etc.", "A couple of other interesting notes about the symbolism here:\n\u2022 In the shot of the two corridors, the end of the bright corridor is fully visible as a portal of light, while the end of the dark corridor is partially obscured by shadows. By choosing the dark, Catra commits to a path whose end she cannot fully predict or control, contrary to the obsession with control that typifies this show\u2019s villains.", "I saw the light corridor as bad, but due to the normal coding of darkness saw them both as bad.
