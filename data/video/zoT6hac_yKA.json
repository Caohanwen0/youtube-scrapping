As another ex catholic, I just learned about the bell thing and the dreidel thing just now from this.", "I can't wait to see you react to the next episode\nEspecially the first few scenes", "David Tennant is the most amazing actor.  Sorry if I missed this in the other responses but he was the best Doctor from the rebooted Doctor Who, an amazing Kilgrave in Jessica Jones, played what the press calls the best Hamlet of the modern era, the voice of Scrooge in the new Duck Tales and his stints in Harry Potter and Broadchurch etc. etc. The list is never ending but the most amazing thing about him is the fact that he is also considered one of the nicest men in the business.  Director Dean Devlin of Independence Day fame (and a real Doctor Who geek) directed him in a movie and said how Tennant could be found between takes helping move props to the next scene!  I met him myself twice and he was a gem to my autistic teenager.  He is now my son's hero and I couldn't ask for a better one."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgrxGYu9u90qBCgV6PIhnmw", "description": "Uncle Tony and sidekick \"Shecky\" share secrets from within their religions.
