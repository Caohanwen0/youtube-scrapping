Thank you Mr Nolan for inspiring me", "This is the episode that 100% convinced me that POI was the best show on network television period. The attention to detail by the writers to create this labyrinth that lasted 20 episodes to complete the arc of Reese's character was nothing short of genius. The pilot created this conflict & it took 21 episodes to bring about a resolution. For the viewers who invested the time to soak in the message all season long, this was a MASSIVE payoff that was well worth it. You have to look to cable to find a show that rivals this level of acting and writing. I miss it.", "After 4 damn years, this still brings tears to my eyes.", "Reese doesn't say sorry, finch does.\n\nFinch: \"Sorry\"\nFinch: \"I'm so sorry\"", "The scene were John looks out the window of his apartment shows that Finch knows what John does in his free time."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJGgbrPkH-VlLsEZPkmycLg", "description": "This show sure knows how to end an episode - So good - \nWe discover Reese's ex-girlfriend was murdered - We know Carter is firmly on Reese and Finch's side"}
