I love stuff like this that gets specific. I've watched this series like 4 times. \nAlso I didn't' realize Alistair Wesley had his own theme.", "I think I'll wait until at least a few episodes of season 3 have aired.

Looking forward to the follow-up."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGU3fjBOY4CYJPgP7W-bguA", "description": "[please read]\nHandy guide to all the various music themes from Person Of Interest. The score is composed by Ramin Djawadi. Finch's and Carter's themes are connected to the main \"Machine theme\".
