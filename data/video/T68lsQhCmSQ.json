Your use of shots of Aziraphale showed clearly that this video is from Crowley's eyes. You also show what Crowley sees in Aziraphale by using the bits of him asking Crowley for help or smiling in all the perfect moments this song provides. The ending is heartwrenching because it shows up in color, like it was at the beginning, showing that all the bits in between were flashbacks and that Aziraphale has let go, despite how much Crowley wanted him to stay. Overall, I love it! Thank you so much for it!", "\u201cAziraphale! For God\u2019s\u2014for Satan\u2019s\u2014for somebody\u2019s sake, WHERE ARE YOU!!!! Somebody killed my best friend!!
