It was an innovated show that was like nothing else presently on television.", "I really like Kevin Chapman, he may not be tall, dark, and handsome like Jim, but I think he has an engaging personality and always gives interesting and thoughtful answers.  Oh, and for some reason, he always seems to be next to Amy, even if they're on the end.", "Only discovered this show about 2 weeks ago and binge watched all 5 seasons in like a week and a half, if that. So sad they canceled it after 5 seasons and the last one only had 13 episodes. It is one of the most brilliantly written shows on TV, the writing is top notch, the character development was so well done, the story line so well thought out, and like everything else great, TV network execs have to kill it cause it's expensive. It's cheaper to do these stupid reality shows I guess. I hope they revive it and Netflix will produce it.", "13:59 Jim is teasing the series finale in which Reese sacrificed himself. \u201cWhat episode are talking about?\u201d, the simulation one or the finale? Then Nolan gets nervous and intervenes XD"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ1zyiCmd3QBRTDw5AoDpgw", "description": "Full panel"}
