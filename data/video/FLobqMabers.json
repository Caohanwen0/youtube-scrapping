Like he totally expected them to just politely wait to be murdered.", "I love OUAT, but I have to admit this plotline of breaking the laws of magic is much better and more interesting than the last season of OUAT with Henry's adventures.", "I freaking LOVE how Jafar goes \"Now where was I?\" after killing his father. It's like a full confirmation to anyone in the audience who thought that receiving closure with his father might be where Jafar's villainy stops that no, he is not going to stop. Nothing can make him stop. Doing this just gave him a fleeting satisfaction and then it's back to business as usual - asserting his power to claim dominance over others and have anything he desires to. He is a truly unsalvageably evil man.", "I think Jafar changed his mind when the Jabberwocky made him remember what it felt like. Up until then he just wanted his father to love him, but when she brought  back that memory he decided that he wanted his father to hurt that much, that he didn't deserve to be happy with love", "Jaguars dad is such a hypocrite. Jafar did try to earn his love but the sultan was just too self centered and stubborn to see it."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGIQHvkZPzrna7UHtmlgoXw", "description": "once upon a time in wonderland- final episode 1x13 (And they lived )\njafar and Amara finally break the laws of magic"}
