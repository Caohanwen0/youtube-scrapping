It's one of, if not the smartest, most compelling TV shows out there. I mean did they WATCH the season five premiere? It was a epically brilliant. They really need to reconsider this asinine idea of giving up on such a magnificent show.", "Root as epic as ever. :D This show will go out with a bang, any other way would be bad and stretching out seasons would be horrible. Loved the intro(Roots voice).", "Can't wait for episode 3, Shaw is back. CBS are idiots, POI is one of the most underated show and the premiere was great. In my ideal hope, all the characters, Root/Shaw, Finch, Reese, get thier happy ending but I really hope they do survive and continue doing thier best......saving people.", "\"Just call me Root, bitch\" Is the best line of tv history. I love this show so much", "still so shocked about the cancellation, but still hopefully a great final season ..."], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Xg5QRWAQaw9N_QQnlc1aA", "description": "Person of Interest 5x02 \"SNAFU\" - The Machine experiences a glitch during rebooting, supplying Reese and Fusco with the numbers of dozens of people not actually involved in crimes, while also locking Finch and Root out after identifying them as threats based on past violent behavior, on PERSON OF INTEREST, Monday, May 9th on CBS.\n\nOfficial website: "}
