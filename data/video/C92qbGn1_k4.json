I will miss it very much.", "Miss this damn good show. Reese was John Wick before John Wick.", "Bring the damn show back!  --And we WANT the WHOLE CREW, include Root and Reese!!!!", "This is the only fan video I have ever seen that struck me as a truly masterful addition to the original work. It's the smallest change, but it resonates more with the style and patterns in the show than the actual ending.  Great work.", "Just wanted to say how truly grateful I am for all the positive feedback. THANK YOU for entrusting me with a bit of your time and feeling it was worth it! Really happy the video is being enjoyed :)"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbIEIwyW_T4TQctiRoDn5KQ", "description": "\u00bb This is a humble video-edit pretending the events through Person of Interest\u2019s s5e10 to s5e13 were all a simulation, a \u201cgame\u201d set in Team Machine\u2019s subway\u2019s Faraday-cage. Both, the Machine and Samaritan, run their possible outcomes based on what they have learned since being operative and online. There are many ways the story could follow, this is only one of the countless possibilities. Hope you enjoy! ~\n\n\u00bb It is only available on PC, neither mobile phones nor tablets will work, I\u2019m really sorry for that!"}
