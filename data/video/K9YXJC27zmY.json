He was the archangel of the Machines army.", "And so Reese once again gains access to God Mode for a little while. My favorite time of him using it is in Return 0 though when the Machine guides him in battle in God Mode during their last battle. The Machine and John Reese fighting side by side one last time.", "I love that moment when the Machine saves him!!! Bad guys are all confused and Reese is like \"OH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay.\" God Mode Activate!!! Its funny: the Brotherhood caused so much problems and all it took was this to take them down!!!", "Loved it when fusco shows his badge and says \" Det.Fusco , you're under arrest , Jackass !!!\" \u2763", "Best scene of the ENTIRE show!"], "authorLink": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjCe8KE9b9WNIw661h9gQnw", "description": "Fight Scene from E22 S04: YHWH"}
